<h3 class="h3head">NOTES ON WITCHCRAFT.</h3>
<br>
<p class="center">BY GEORGE LYMAN KITTREDGE.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We are all specialists now-a-days, I suppose. The good
old times of the polymath and the Doctor Universalis
are gone forever. Yet signs are not wanting that some of
us are alive to the danger of building our party-walls too
high. In one respect, at all events, there can be no doubt
that the investigators of New England antiquities are aware
of their peril, though they occasionally shut their eyes to
it,—I mean, the tendency to consider the Colonists as a
peculiar people, separated from the Mother Country not
only geographically, but also with regard to those currents
of thought and feeling which are the most significant facts
of history. True, there is more or less justification for that
kind of study which looks at the annals of America as ends-in-themselves;
but such study is ticklish business, and it
now and then distorts the perspective in a rather fantastic
way. This is a rank truism. Still, commonplaces are
occasionally steadying to the intellect, and Dr. Johnson—whose
own truths have been characterized by a brilliant
critic as “too true”—knew what he was about when he
said that men usually need not so much to be informed as
to be reminded.</p>

<p>The darkest page of New England history is, by common
consent, that which is inscribed with the words Salem Witchcraft.
The hand of the apologist trembles as it turns the
leaf. The reactionary writer who prefers iconoclasm to
hero-worship sharpens his pen and pours fresh gall into his
inkpot when he comes to this sinister subject. Let us try
to consider the matter, for a few minutes, unemotionally,
and to that end let us pass in review a number of facts
which may help us to look at the Witchcraft Delusion of
1692 in its due proportions,—not as an abnormal outbreak
of fanaticism, not as an isolated tragedy, but as a mere
incident, a brief and transitory episode in the biography of
a terrible, but perfectly natural, superstition.</p>

<p>In the first place, we know that the New Englanders did
not invent the belief in witchcraft.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> It is a universally
human belief. No race or nation is exempt from it. Formerly,
it was an article in the creed of everybody in the
world, and it is still held, in some form or other, and to a
greater or less extent, by a large majority of mankind.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, our own attitude of mind toward witchcraft
is a very modern attitude indeed. To us, one who asserts
the existence, or even the possibility, of the crime of witchcraft
staggers under a burden of proof which he cannot
conceivably support. His thesis seems to us unreasonable,
abnormal, monstrous; it can scarcely be stated in intelligible
terms; it savors of madness. Now, before we can do any
kind of justice to our forefathers,—a matter, be it remembered,
of no moment to them, for they have gone to their
reward, but, I take it, of considerable importance to us,—we
must empty our heads of all such rationalistic ideas.
To the contemporaries of William Stoughton and Samuel
Sewall the existence of this crime was not merely an historical
phenomenon, it was a fact of contemporary experience.
Whoever denied the occurrence of witchcraft in the past,
was an atheist; whoever refused to admit its actual possibility
in the present, was either stubbornly incredulous,
or destitute of the ability to draw an inference. Throughout
the seventeenth century, very few persons could be found—not
merely in New England, but in the whole world—who
would have ventured to take so radical a position. That
there had been witches and sorcerers in antiquity was
beyond cavil. That there were, or might be, witches and
sorcerers in the present was almost equally certain. The
crime was recognized by the Bible, by all branches of the
Church, by philosophy, by natural science, by the medical
faculty, by the law of England. I do not offer these postulates
as novelties. They are commonplaces. They will not be attacked
by anybody who has even a slight acquaintance with
the mass of testimony that might be adduced to establish them.</p>

<p>It is a common practice to ascribe the tenets of the New
Englanders in the matter of witchcraft to something peculiar
about their religious opinions,—to what is loosely called
their Puritan theology. This is a very serious error. The
doctrines of our forefathers differed, in this regard, from
the doctrines of the Roman and the Anglican Church in no
essential,—one may safely add, in no particular. Lord
Bacon was not a Puritan,—yet he has left his belief in sorcery
recorded in a dozen places. James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> was not a Puritan,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> but
his Dæmonologie (1597) is a classic treatise, his zeal in
prosecuting sorcerers is notorious, and his statute of 1603<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
was the act under which Matthew Hopkins, in the time of
the Commonwealth, sent two hundred witches to the gallows
in two years,—nearly ten times as many as perished in
Massachusetts from the first settlement to the beginning
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Matthew Hopkins, the Witch-Finder General, apparently
<i>was</i> a Puritan. Indeed, it is his career, more than anything
that ever happened in New England, which has led to
the reiterated statement that Puritanism was especially
favorable, by its temper and its tenets, to prosecution for
witchcraft. For his activity falls in the time of the Commonwealth,
and the Parliament granted a Special Commission of
Oyer and Terminer, in 1645, to try some of the witches
that he had detected, and Edmund Calamy was associated
with the Commission. But, on the other hand, it must be
noted that John Gaule, who opposed Hopkins and is usually
credited with most influence in putting an end to his performances,
was also a Puritan,—and a minister likewise, and a
believer in witches as well. The Hopkins outbreak, as we
shall see, must be laid to the disturbed condition of the
country rather than to the prevalence of any particular
system of theology.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> Under Cromwell’s government, witch
trials languished, not because the belief in witchcraft changed,
but because there was order once more. So in Scotland,
the conquest by Cromwell checked one of the fiercest prosecutions
ever known. The Restoration was followed, both
in England and in Scotland, by a marked recrudescence of
prosecution.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>But we must return to Matthew Hopkins. Let us see
how his discoveries affected James Howell. In 1647 Howell
writes to Endymion Porter: “We have likewise multitudes
of <em>Witches</em> among us, for in <em>Essex</em> and <em>Suffolk</em> there were
above two hundred indicted within these two years, and
above the one half of them executed: More, I may well say,
than ever this Island bred since the Creation, I speak it
with horror. God guard us from the Devil, for I think he
was never so busy upon any part of the Earth that was enlightned
with the beams of <em>Christianity</em>; nor do I wonder at it,
for there’s never a Cross left to fright him away.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> In the
following year, Howell writes to Sir Edward Spencer an
elaborate defence of the current tenets in witchcraft and
demonology.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> One striking passage demands quotation:—“Since
the beginning of these unnatural Wars, there may
be a cloud of Witnesses produc’d for the proof of this black
Tenet: For within the compass of two years, near upon three
hundred Witches were arraign’d, and the major part executed
in <em>Essex</em> and <em>Suffolk</em> only. <em>Scotland</em> swarms with them now
more than ever, and Persons of good Quality executed daily.”</p>

<p>It is confidently submitted that nobody will accuse Howell
of Puritanism. The letters from which our extracts are
taken were written while he was a prisoner in the Fleet
under suspicion of being a Royalist spy.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> His mention of
the disappearance of crosses throughout England will not
be overlooked by the discriminating reader. It will be noted
also that he seems to have perceived a connection—a real
one, as we shall see later—<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> between the increase in witchcraft
and the turmoil of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Jeremy Taylor was surely no Puritan; but he believed
in witchcraft. It is a sin, he tells us, that is “infallibly
desperate,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> and in his Holy Living (1650) he has even
given the weight of his authority to the reality of sexual
relations between witches and the devil.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not in Puritan times, but in 1664, four years after
the Restoration, that Sir Matthew Hale, then Chief Baron
of the Exchequer, pronounced from the bench the following
opinion in the Bury St. Edmunds case:—“That there were
such Creatures as <em>Witches</em> he made no doubt at all; For <em>First</em>,
the Scriptures had affirmed so much. <em>Secondly</em>, The wisdom
of all Nations had provided Laws against such Persons,
which is an Argument of their confidence of such a crime.
And such hath been the judgment of this Kingdom, as
appears by that Act of Parliament<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> which hath provided
Punishments proportionable to the quality of the Offence.
And desired them [the jury], strictly to observe their
Evidence; and desired the great God of Heaven to direct
their Hearts in this weighty thing they had in hand: <em>For
to Condemn the Innocent, and to let the Guilty go free, were
both an Abomination to the Lord</em>.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> Hale’s words were
fraught with momentous consequences, for he was “allowed
on all hands to be the most profound lawyer of his time,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
and the Bury case became a precedent of great weight. “It
was,” writes Cotton Mather, “a Tryal much considered by
the Judges of New England.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Hale’s conduct on this occasion has of course subjected
him to severe criticism. Lord Campbell, for example,
goes so far as to declare that he “murdered” the old
women,—a dictum which shows but slight comprehension
of the temper of the seventeenth century. More
creditable to Campbell’s historical sense is the following
passage:—“Although, at the present day, we
regard this trial as a most lamentable exhibition of
credulity and inhumanity, I do not know that it at
all lowered Hale in public estimation in his own life.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
Bishop Burnet, as is well-known, makes no mention
of the case in his Life of Hale.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span> One might surmise
that he omitted it out of respect for his hero’s memory,
since his little book is rather an obituary tribute than a
biography. More probably, however, Burnet did not regard
the case as any more significant than many other decisions of
Hale’s which he likewise passed over in silence. Unequivocal
evidence that the Bury trial did not injure Hale’s reputation
may be found in the silence of Roger North. North’s
elaborate character of Hale, in his Life of the Lord Keeper
Guilford,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> is notoriously prejudiced in the extreme.
Though admitting Hale’s legal learning and many good
qualities, North loses no opportunity to attack his record.
Besides, North praises the Lord Keeper for his conduct in
procuring the acquittal of an alleged witch. If, then, the
Bury case had seemed to him especially discreditable, or
if he had thought that it afforded an opening for hostile
criticism, we cannot doubt that he would have spoken out
in condemnation. His complete silence on the subject is
therefore the most emphatic testimony to the general
approval of Hale’s proceedings. Highly significant, too,
is the fact that even Lord Campbell does not blame Hale
for believing in witchcraft, but only for allowing weight to
the evidence in this particular case. “I would very readily
have pardoned him,” he writes, “for an undoubting belief in
witchcraft, and I should have considered that this belief
detracted little from his character for discernment and
humanity. The Holy Scriptures teach us that, in some ages
of the world, wicked persons, by the agency of evil spirits,
were permitted, through means which exceed the ordinary
powers of nature, to work mischief to their fellow-creatures....
In the reign of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, a judge who from the
bench should have expressed a disbelief in [magic and the
black art] would have been thought to show little respect
for human laws, and to be nothing better than an atheist.”
We may profitably compare what Guilford himself (then
Francis North, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas) wrote
of the Devonshire witches in 1682,—nearly twenty years
after the Bury case:—“We cannot reprieve them, without
appearing to deny the very being of witches, which, as it is
contrary to law, so I think it would be ill for his Majesty’s
service, for it may give the faction occasion to set afoot
the old trade of witch-finding, that may cost many innocent
persons their lives which the justice will prevent.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne, the author of the Religio Medici,
was no Puritan, and he was one of the leading scientific
men of his day. Yet he gave his opinion, as an expert,
at the request of the Court in this same Bury St. Edmunds
case, to the following effect:—“That the Devil in such cases
did work upon the Bodies of Men and Women, upon a
Natural Foundation, (that is) to stir up, and excite such
humours super-abounding in their Bodies to a great excess,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
and further, that “he conceived, that these swouning Fits
were Natural, and nothing else but what they call the
Mother,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> but only heightned to a great excess by the
subtilty of the Devil, co-operating with the Malice of these
which we term Witches, at whose Instance he doth these
Villanies.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Browne has been much blamed for this dictum, but there
is nothing unreasonable or unscientific in it, if one merely
grants the actuality of demoniacal possession, which was
then to all intents and purposes an article of faith. If
the devil can work upon our bodies at all, of course he can
intensify any natural fits or spasms from which we happen
to be suffering. Thus Browne’s diagnosis of the disease
in this case as hysteria, by no means excluded the hypothesis
of <i lang="la">maleficium</i>. But most modern writers refuse to discuss
such subjects except <i lang="fr">de haut en bas</i>,—from the vantage-ground
of modern science.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne’s view was, it seems, substantially
identical with that of his predecessor, the famous Robert
Burton,—no Puritan either!—who has a whole subsection
“Of Witches and Magitians, how they cause Melancholy,”
asserting that what “they can doe, is as much almost as the
Diuell himselfe, who is still ready to satisfie their desires, to
oblige them the more vnto him.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph Glanvill, the author of The Vanity of Dogmatizing,
was no Puritan,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span> but a skeptical philosopher, a Fellow of
the Royal Society, and Chaplain in Ordinary to King Charles
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; neither was his friend, Dr. Henry More, the most celebrated
of the Cambridge Platonists. Yet these two scholars
and latitudinarians joined forces to produce that extraordinary
treatise, Saducismus Triumphatus: or, A Full and
Plain Evidence concerning Witches and Apparitions. This
book, an enlarged form of Glanvill’s Philosophical Considerations
concerning Witchcraft (1666), was published in 1681,
and went through no less than five editions, the last appearing
as late as 1726.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> It was thought to have put
the belief in apparitions and witchcraft on an unshakable
basis of science and philosophy.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span> No English
work on the subject had a more powerful influence.
When the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Hale, of Beverley, wrote his
Modest Enquiry,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> which deplored the Salem excesses and
protested against spectral evidence,—a notable treatise,
published, with a prefatory epistle from the venerable
Higginson,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> in 1702,—he was able to condense the affirmative
part of his argument, because, as he himself says, Glanvill
“hath strongly proved the being of Witches.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Meric Casaubon, Prebend of Canterbury, was not a
Puritan; yet the second part of his Credulity and Incredulity
(1668) contains a vigorous assertion of demonology and
witch-lore, and was republished in 1672 under the alluring
title, A Treatise Proving Spirits, Witches and Supernatural
Operations by Pregnant Instances and Evidences.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Ralph Cudworth, the antagonist of Hobbes, was not a
Puritan. Yet in his great Intellectual System he declares
for the existence of sorcery, and even admits a distinction
between its higher operations—as in the <ins title="theourgia">θεουργία</ins> of Apollonius
of Tyana<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>—and the vulgar performances of everyday
wizards.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span> There is some reason, too, for supposing that
Cudworth took part with Henry More in examining certain
witches at Cambridge, and heard one of them try to recite
the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer, as she had offered to do
“as an argument she was no witch.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert Boyle, the improver of the air-pump and the
discoverer of Boyle’s Law, had “particular and considerable
advantages to persuade [him], upon good grounds” that
some witch stories are true, and he thought that Glanvill’s
investigations would do “a good service to religion.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
This was in 1677. In the following year Boyle declared
his belief<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
in the performances of the devil of Mascon.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
Boyle’s religious views did not hinder him from being a
leader in that fervor of scientific experimentation which
is one of the glories of the latter half of the seventeenth
century. And he too was not a Puritan.</p>

<p>Isaac Barrow, the master of Newton, was not a Puritan.
Yet he left on record, in one of his sermons, one of the most
powerful and eloquent of all protests against disbelief in
the kind of phenomena which our ancestors are so often
attacked for crediting. The passage is long, but must be
quoted in full, for every word is of weight:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I may adjoin to the former sorts of extraordinary
actions, some other sorts, the consideration of which
(although not so directly and immediately) may serve our
main design; those (which the general opinion of mankind
hath approved, and manifold testimony hath declared frequently
to happen) which concern apparitions from another
world, as it were, of beings unusual; concerning spirits
haunting persons and places, (these discerned by all senses,
and by divers kinds of effects;) of which the old world (the
ancient poets and historians) did speak so much, and of
which all ages have afforded several attestations very direct
and plain, and having all advantages imaginable to beget
credence; concerning visions made unto persons of especial
eminency and influence, (to priests and prophets;) concerning
presignifications of future events by dreams; concerning
the power of enchantments, implying the cooperation
of invisible powers; concerning all sorts of intercourse and
confederacy (formal or virtual) with bad spirits: all which
things he that shall affirm to be mere fiction and delusion,
must thereby with exceeding immodesty and rudeness
charge the world with extreme both vanity and malignity;
many, if not all, worthy historians, of much inconsiderateness
or fraud; most lawgivers, of great silliness and rashness;
most judicatories, of high stupidity or cruelty; a vast number
of witnesses, of the greatest malice or madness; all
which concurred to assert these matters of fact.</p>

<p>“It is true, no question, but there have been many vain
pretences, many false reports, many unjust accusations,
and some undue decisions concerning these matters; that
the vulgar sort is apt enough to be abused about them;
that even intelligent and considerate men may at a distance
in regard to some of them be imposed upon; but, as there
would be no false gems obtruded, if there were no true ones
found in nature; as no counterfeit coin would appear, were
there no true one current; so neither can we well suppose
that a confidence in some to feign, or a readiness in most
to believe, stories of this kind could arise, or should subsist,
without some real ground, or without such things having
in gross somewhat of truth and reality. However, that
the wiser and more refined sort of men, highest in parts
and improvements both from study and experience, (indeed
the flower of every commonwealth; statesmen, lawgivers,
judges, and priests,) upon so many occasions of great importance,
after most deliberate scanning such pretences and
reports, should so often suffer themselves to be deluded,
to the extreme injury of particular persons concerned, to
the common abusing of mankind, to the hazard of their
own reputation in point of wisdom and honesty, seems
nowise reasonable to conceive. In likelihood rather the
whole kind of all these things, were it altogether vain and
groundless, would upon so frequent and so mature discussions
have appeared to be so, and would consequently long
since have been disowned, exploded, and thrust out of the
world; for, as upon this occasion it is said in Tully, ‘Time
wipeth out groundless conceits, but confirms that which
is founded in nature, and real.’</p>

<p>“Now if the truth and reality of these things, (all or
any of them,) inferring the existence of powers invisible, at
least inferior ones, though much superior to us in all sort
of ability, be admitted, it will at least (as removing the
chief obstacles of incredulity) confer much to the belief of
that supreme Divinity, which our Discourse strives
to maintain.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Hickes"></a>Dr. George Hickes, of Thesaurus fame, was one of the
most eminent scholars of his time. He was also a Non-juror,
and titular Bishop of Thetford. In other words, he was
not a Puritan. Yet in 1678 Hickes published an account
of the infamous Major Weir, the most celebrated of all
Scottish wizards, which betrays no skepticism on the cardinal
points of sorcery.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> There is also an extremely interesting
letter from the Doctor to Mr. Pepys, dated June 19, 1700,
which indicates a belief in witchcraft and second sight.
The most curious part of this letter, however, deals with Elf
Arrows. “I have another strange story,” writes Dr. Hickes,
“but very well attested, of an Elf arrow, that was shot at
a venerable Irish Bishop by an Evil Spirit in a terrible noise,
louder than thunder, which shaked the house where the
Bishop was; but this I reserve for his son to tell you, who
is one of the deprived Irish Clergymen, and very well known,
as by other excellent pieces, so by his late book, entitled,
‘The Snake in the Grass.’”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> What would the critics say
if this passage were found in a work of Cotton Mather’s?</p>

<p>Finally, it is not amiss to remember that the tolerant,
moderate, and scholarly John Evelyn, whom nobody will
accuse of being a Puritan, made the following entry in his
Diary under February <abbr title="third" >3d</abbr>, 1692-3:—“Unheard-of stories
of the universal increase of Witches in New England; men,
women and children devoting themselves to the devil, so
as to threaten the subversion of the government. At the
same time there was a conspiracy amongst the negroes in
Barbadoes to murder all their masters, discovered by overhearing
a discourse of two of the slaves, and so preventing
the execution of the designe.” There is no indication
that Evelyn regarded either of these conspiracies as less
possible of occurrence than the other.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of these passages are sufficiently well known, and
their significance in the abstract is cheerfully granted, I
suppose, by everybody. But the cumulative effect of so
much testimony from non-Puritans is, I fear, now and
then disregarded or overlooked by writers who concern
themselves principally with the annals of New England.
Yet the bearing of the evidence is plain enough. The
Salem outbreak was not due to Puritanism; it is not assignable
to any peculiar temper on the part of our New England
ancestors; it is no sign of exceptional bigotry or abnormal
superstition. Our forefathers believed in witchcraft, not
because they were Puritans, not because they were Colonials,
not because they were New Englanders,—but because
they were men of their time. They shared the feelings
and beliefs of the best hearts and wisest heads of the seventeenth
century. What more can be asked of them?<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>I am well aware that there are a few distinguished names
that are always entered on the other side of the account,
and some of them we must now consider. It would be
unpardonable to detract in any <a id="manner"></a>manner from the dear-bought
fame of such forerunners of a better dispensation.
But we must not forget that they were forerunners. They
occupy a much more conspicuous place in modern books
than they occupied in the minds of their contemporaries.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
Further, if we listen closely to the words of these voices in
the wilderness, we shall find that they do not sound in unison,
and that then testimony is not in all cases precisely what
we should infer from the loose statements often made about
them.</p>

<p>Johann Wier, or Weyer (1515-1588), deserves all the
honor he has ever received. He devoted years to the study
of demonology, and brought his great learning, and his
vast experience as a physician, to bear on the elucidation of
the whole matter.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span> He held that many of the performances
generally ascribed to devils and witches were impossible,
and that the witches themselves were deluded. But there
is another side to the picture. Wier’s book is crammed
full of what we should now-a-days regard as the grossest
superstition. He credited Satan and his attendant demons
with extensive powers. He believed that the fits of the
so-called bewitched persons were due in large part to
demoniacal possession or obsession, and that the witches
themselves, though innocent of what was alleged against
them, were in many cases under the influence of the devil,
who made them think that they had entered into infernal
compacts, and ridden through the air on broomsticks, and
killed their neighbors’ pigs, and caused disease or death by
occult means. And further, he was convinced that such
persons as Faust, whom he called <dfn>magi</dfn>, were acquainted
with strange and damnable arts, and that they were
worthy of death and their books of the fire. One example
may serve to show the world-wide difference between Wier’s
mental attitude and our own.</p>

<p>One of the best known symptoms of bewitchment was
the vomiting of bones, nails, needles, balls of wool, bunches
of hair, and other things, some of which were so large that
they could not have passed through the throat by any
natural means.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span> Such phenomena, Wier tells us, he had
himself seen. How were they to be explained? Easily,
according to Wier’s general theory. Such articles, he says,
are put into the patient’s mouth by the devil; one after
another, as fast as they come out. We cannot see him
do this,—either because he acts so rapidly that his motions
are invisible, or because he fascinates our sight, or because
he darkens our eyes, perhaps by interposing between them
and the patient some aërial body.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The instability of Wier’s position should not be brought
against him as a reproach, since he was far in advance of
his contemporaries, and since his arguments against the
witch dogma are the foundation of all subsequent skepticism
on the subject.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span> Besides, it is certain that such a thorough-going
denial of the devil’s power as Bekker made a century
later would have utterly discredited Wier’s book and might
even have prevented it from being published at all.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span>
Yet, when all is said and done, it must be admitted that
Wier’s doctrines have a half-hearted appearance, and that
they seemed to most seventeenth-century scholars to labor
under a gross inconsistency. This inconsistency was emphasized
by Meric Casaubon. “As for them,” writes Dr.
Casaubon, “who allow and acknowledge <em>supernatural
operations</em> by Devils and Spirits, as <cite>Wierius</cite>;who tells as
many strange stories of them, and as <em>incredible</em>, as are to be
found in any book; but stick at the business of <em>Witches</em> only,
whom they would not have thought the Authors of those
mischiefs, that are usually laid to their charge, but the Devil
only; though this opinion may seem to some, to have more of
<em>charity</em>, than <em>Incredulity</em>; yet the contrary will easily appear
to them, that shall look into it more carefully.” And
Casaubon dwells upon the fact that Wier grants “no small
part of what we drive at, when he doth acknowledge <em>supernatural
operations</em>, by Devils and Spirits.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span> Indeed, the
apparent contradiction in Wier’s theories may also excuse
Casaubon for the suggestion he makes that Wier’s intention
“was not so much to favour <em>women</em>, as the <em>Devil</em> himself,
with whom, it is to be feared, that he was too well
acquainted.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span> This reminds us of what King James
had already written of “Wierus, a German Physition,” who
“sets out a publike Apologie for all these craftes-folkes,
whereby, procuring for their impunitie, he plainely bewrayes
himselfe to have bene one of that profession.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald Scot’s Discoverie of Witchcraft appeared in
1584. Scot, who was largely indebted to Wier, goes much
farther than his Continental predecessor. Of course he
does not deny the existence of evil spirits;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span> but he does
not believe, like Wier, that evil spirits are continually
occupied in deluding mankind by all manner of false (or
præstigious) appearances. Such deceits he ascribes to
juggling, and he accordingly gives elaborate directions
for the performance of various tricks of legerdemain.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>There seems to be a more or less prevalent impression
that Scot’s book explodes witchcraft so thoroughly that
the whole delusion might soon have come to an end in
England if James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> had not mounted the throne a short time
after it was published. True, King James’s Dæmonologie is
expressly directed “against the damnable opinions” of
Wier and Scot.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span> But, to tell the truth, Scot’s treatise
did not require a royal refutation. To us moderns, who
are converted already and need no repentance, its general
air of reasonableness, together with its humor and the
raciness of the style, makes the Discoverie seem convincing
enough. But this is to look at the matter from a mistaken
point of view. The question is, not how Scot’s arguments
affect us, but how they were likely to affect his contemporaries.
Now, if the truth must be told, the Discoverie is deficient
in one very important respect. It makes no satisfactory
answer to the insistent questions: “What are these evil
spirits of which the Bible and the philosophers tell us,
and which everybody believes in, and always has believed
in, from the beginning of time? And what are they about?
If they are powerful and malignant, why is it not likely
that the effects which everybody ascribes to them are really
their work? And if they are eager not only to torment
but to seduce mankind, why is it not reasonable to suppose
that they accomplish both ends at the same time—kill
two birds with one stone—by procuring such evil effects
by means of witches, or by allowing themselves to be
utilized by witches as instruments of malice?” It was
quite proper to ask these questions of Scot. He admitted the
existence of evil spirits, but declared that we know little
or nothing about them, denied that they can produce the
phenomena then generally ascribed to their agency, and
alleged fraud and delusion to account for such phenomena.
Even to us, with our extraordinary and very modern
incredulity toward supernatural occurrences, the lacuna
in Scot’s reasoning is clear enough if we only look at his
argument as a whole. This we are not inclined to do; at
least, no historian of witchcraft has ever done it. It is
easier and more natural for us to accept such portions of
Scot’s argument as agree with our own view, to compliment
him for his perspicacity, and to pass on, disregarding the
inadequacy of what he says about evil spirits. Or, if we
notice that his utterances on this topic are halting and
uncertain, we are tempted to regard such hesitancy as
further evidence of his rational temper. He could not
quite deny the existence of devils, we feel,—that would
have been too much to expect of him; but he waves them
aside like a sensible man.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span> A moment’s consideration,
however, will show us that this defect in Scot’s case, trifling
as it appears to us now-a-days, was in fact a very serious
thing. To us, who never think of admitting the intervention
of evil spirits in the affairs of this world, the question
whether there are any such spirits at all has a purely theoretical
interest. Indeed, we practically deny their existence
when we ignore them as we do: <i lang="la">de non apparentibus et non
existentibus eadem est lex</i>.—But to Scot’s contemporaries,
the question of the existence of evil spirits involved the
whole matter in debate,—and Scot granted their existence.</p>

<p>A curious particular in the history of Scot’s Discoverie
should also be considered in estimating its effect on the
seventeenth century. The appearance of a new edition
in 1665, shortly after the famous Bury St. Edmunds case,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span>
may at first sight seem to indicate powerful and continuing
influence on the part of the Discoverie. When we observe
from the title-page, however, that the publisher has inserted
nine chapters at the beginning of Book <span class="allsmcap">XV</span>, and has added a
second book to the Treatise on Divels and Spirits, our
curiosity is excited. Investigation soon shows that these
additions were calculated to destroy or minimize the total
effect of Scot’s book. The prefixed chapters contain directions
for making magical circles, for calling up “the ghost of
one that hath hanged himself,” and for raising various orders
of spirits. These chapters are thrust in without any attempt
to indicate that they are not consistent with Scot’s general
plan and his theories. They appear to be, and are, practical
directions for magic and necromancy. The additional
book is even more dangerous to Scot’s design. It is prefaced
by the remark:—“Because the Author in his foregoing
Treatise, upon the <cite>Nature of Spirits and Devils</cite>, hath only
touched the subject thereof superficially, omitting the
more material part; and with a brief and cursory Tractat,
hath concluded to speak the least of this subject which
indeed requires most amply to be illustrated; therefore
I thought fit to adjoyn this subsequent discourse; as succedaneous
to the fore-going, and conducing to the compleating
of the whole work.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>How far “this subsequent discourse” is really fitted
to complete Scot’s work may be judged by a statement
which it makes on the very first page, to the effect that
bad spirits “are the grand Instigators, stirring up mans heart
to attempt the inquiry after the darkest, and most mysterious
part of Magick, or Witchcraft.” And again a little
later:—“Great is the villany of Necromancers, and wicked
Magicians, in dealing with the spirits of men departed;
whom they invocate, with certain forms, and conjurations,
digging up their Carkasses again, or by the help of Sacrifices,
and Oblations to the infernal Gods; compelling the
Ghost to present it self before them.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span> All this is quite
opposed to Scot’s view and the whole intention of his book.
The insertion of such worthless matter was, of course,
a mere trick of the bookseller to make a new edition go
off well. But the fact of its insertion shows that Scot
was thought to have left his treatise incomplete or unsatisfactory
in a most important point. And the inserted
matter itself must have gone far to neutralize the effect
of republication in a witch-haunted period. And so we
may leave Reginald Scot, with our respect for his courage
and common sense undiminished, but with a clear idea
of the slight effect which his treatise must have had on
the tone and temper of the age that we are studying.</p>

<p>John Webster’s Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft,
which appeared in 1677—the Preface is dated “February
23. 1673”—was particularly directed against Glanvill
and Meric Casaubon. It holds a distinguished place in
the history of witchcraft, and demands our careful scrutiny.
What is usually thought of it has been eloquently expressed
by the late Mr. James Crossley. “In this memorable book,”
writes Mr. Crossley, “he exhausts the subject, as far as
it is possible to do so, by powerful ridicule, cogent arguments,
and the most varied and well applied learning, leaving
to [Francis] Hutchinson, and others who have since followed
in his track, little further necessary than to reproduce
his facts and reasonings in a more popular, it can scarcely
be said, in a more effective form.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>A few of Webster’s opinions must be specified, that
the reader may judge how far The Displaying of Supposed
Witchcraft deserves to rank as a work of sober and scientific
reason, and to what extent the author merits the
position that seems to be traditionally assigned to him as
an uncompromising assailant of superstition.</p>

<p>Angels, good and bad, are “really and truly corporeal”
and not spirits, except “in a relative and respective” sense.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
Since devils are corporeal, Webster admits that “they may
move and agitate other bodies.” Their strength, however,
is limited, “for though one Devil may be supposed to move
or lift up that which would load an Horse, yet it will
not follow that he can move or lift up as much as would
load a Ship of a thousand Tun.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span> Webster grants that
“God doth make use of evil Angels to punish the wicked,
and to chastise and afflict the godly, and in the effecting
of these things that they have a power given them to hurt
the earth and the Sea and things therein, as to bring tempests,
thunder, lightning, plague, death, drought and the
like.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster has a profound belief in apparitions and tells
some capital ghost stories<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span>—“unquestionable testimonies,”
he calls them, “either from our own Annals, or matters
of fact that we know to be true of our own certain knowledge,
that thereby it may undoubtedly appear, that there are effects
that exceed the ordinary power of natural causes, and
may for ever convince all Atheisticall minds.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span> One of
these tales concerns the murder of one Fletcher by Ralph
Raynard, an innkeeper, and Mark Dunn, a hired assassin.
One day “the spirit of <em>Fletcher</em> in his usual shape and habit
did appear unto [Raynard], and said, Oh <em>Raph</em>, repent,
repent, for my revenge is at hand.” The result was a
full confession. “I have recited this story punctually,”
writes Webster, “as a thing that hath been very much
fixed in my memory, being then but young, and as a
certain truth, I being (with many more) an ear-witness
of their confessions and an eye-witness of their
Executions, and likewise saw <em>Fletcher</em> when he was taken
up, where they had buried him in his cloaths, which were
a green fustian doublet pinkt upon white, gray breeches,
and his walking boots and brass spurrs without rowels.”
The spectre, Webster is convinced, was an “extrinsick
apparition to <em>Raynard</em>,” and not the mere effect of a guilty
conscience “which represented the shape of <em>Fletcher</em> in
his fancy.” The thing could not, he thinks, “be brought
to pass either by the Devil, or <em>Fletchers</em> Soul,” and therefore
he “concludes that either it was wrought by the Divine
Power, ... or that it was the Astral or Sydereal Spirit of
<em>Fletcher</em>, seeking revenge for the murther.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster also believes fully in the “bleeding or cruentation
of the bodies of those that have been murthered,” particularly
at the touch of the murderer or in his presence,
and he gives a very curious collection of examples, in some
of which “the murtherers had not been certainly known
but by the bleeding of the body murthered.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span> The most
probable explanation of such phenomena he finds in the
existence of the astral spirit, “that, being a middle substance,
betwixt the Soul and the Body doth, when separated from
the Body, wander or hover near about it, bearing with it
the irascible and concupiscible faculties, wherewith being
stirred up to hatred and revenge, it causeth that ebullition
and motion in the blood, that exudation of blood upon
the weapon, and those other wonderful motions of the
Body, Hands, Nostrils and Lips, thereby to discover the
murtherer, and bring him to condign punishment.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
In some cases, however, Webster holds that the soul
has not actually departed, “and God may in his just judgment
suffer the Soul to stay longer in the murthered Body,
that the cry of blood may make known the murtherer,
or may not so soon, for the same reason, call it totally
away.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>These specimens of Webster’s temper of mind might
perhaps suffice to show with what slight justification he
has been regarded as a scientific rationalist. We must
not dismiss him, however, until we have scrutinized his
views on the subject of witchcraft itself. He passes for
a strong denier of the whole business of sorcery. We
shall find that this is a great mistake. So far from denying
the existence of witches, Webster is indignant at the
imputation that his theories and those of other like-minded
scholars should be interpreted in any such sense. “If
I deny that a Witch cannot flye in the air, nor be transformed
or transubstantiated into a Cat, a Dog, or an Hare, or that
the Witch maketh any visible Covenant with the Devil,
or that he sucketh on their bodies, or that the Devil hath
carnal Copulation with them; I do not thereby deny either
the Being of Witches, nor other properties that they may
have, for which they may be so called: no more than if
I deny that a dog hath rugibility (which is only proper to
a Lion) doth it follow that I deny the being of a Dog, or
that he hath latrability?”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span> This sentence contains, in
effect, the sum and substance of Webster’s negative
propositions on the subject.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span> Let us see what he holds
as affirmatives.</p>

<p>Though rejecting the theory of an external covenant
between the devil and a witch, Webster acknowledges
“an internal, mental, and spiritual League or Covenant
betwixt the Devil and all wicked persons.” Further,
“this spiritual League in some respects and in some persons
may be, and is an explicit League, that is, the persons
that enter into it, are or may be conscious of it, and know
it to be so.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span> Now there are certain persons, commonly
called witches, who are full of “hatred, malice, revenge
and envy,” of which the devil is the “author and causer,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span>
and these, by Satan’s instigation, “do secretly and by
tradition learn strange poysons, philters and receipts
whereby they do much hurt and mischief. Which most
strange wayes of poysoning, tormenting, and breeding
of unwonted things in the stomach and bellies of people,
have not been unknown unto many learned men and
Philosophers.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span> Among these effects of “an art more
than Diabolical,” which has “been often practiced by
most horrible, malevolent, and wicked persons,” is the
production of the plague. There is no doubt of the fact.
There are “undeniable examples.” An unguent may be
prepared which is of such power that when it is smeared
upon the handles of doors, “those that do but lightly touch
them are forthwith infected.” In 1536 there was a conspiracy
of some forty persons in Italy, who caused the death of
many in this way.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span> To such arts Webster ascribes the
dreadful outbreak of jail-fever at the Oxford assizes in
1579. This was not, and could not be, the ordinary “prison
infection.” It was brought about by the contrivances
of one Roland Jenks, “a Popish recusant,” who was
condemned for seditious words against the queen. Jenks,
it seems, had procured strange poisons of a local apothecary,
and had made a kind of candle out of them. As soon as
he was condemned, he lighted his candle, from which there
arose such a “damp,” or steam, that the pestilence broke
out as we have seen.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span> It is manifest, Webster holds,
“that these kind of people that are commonly called
Witches, are indeed (as both the Greek and Latin names
doe signifie) Poysoners, and in respect of their Hellish designs
are Diabolical, but the effects they procure flow from natural
Causes.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span> This last proposition is, indeed, perhaps the
chief point of Webster’s book. Witches exist, and they
do horrible things, but they accomplish their ends, not by
the actual intervention of the devil and his imps, but by
virtue of an acquaintance with little-known laws of nature.
Another example, which cannot be quoted in detail, will
make Webster’s position perfectly clear. A man was
afflicted with a dreadful disease. The cause was discovered
to be the presence of an oaken pin in the corner of a courtyard.
The pin was destroyed and the man drank birchen
ale. He made a complete recovery. It is plain, according to
Webster, that the pulling up and burning of the oaken pin
“was with the help of the Birchen Ale the cure; but it can no
wayes be judged necessary that the Devil should fix the Oak
pin there, but that the Witch might do it himself. Neither can
it be thought to be any power given by the Devil to the Oaken
pin, that it had not by nature, for in all probability it will constantly
by a natural power produce the same effect; only thus
far the Devil had a hand in the action, to draw some wicked person
to fix the pin there ..., thereby to hurt and torture him.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>One is tempted to still further quotations from Webster’s
utterances on this topic, especially because his book has
been much oftener mentioned than read. But we must
rest content with one passage which sums up the whole
matter:—“The opinions that we reject as foolish and impious
are those we have often named before, to wit, that those
that are vulgarly accounted Witches, make a visible and
corporeal contract with the Devil, that he sucks upon their
bodies, that he hath carnal copulation with them, that
they are transubstantiated into Cats, Dogs, Squirrels, and
the like, or that they raise tempests, and fly in the air.
Other powers we grant unto them, to operate and effect
whatsoever the force of natural imagination joyned with envy,
malice and vehement desire of revenge, can perform or perpetrate,
or whatsoever hurt may be done by secret poysons
and such like wayes that work by meer natural means.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that Webster opposed some of the current
witch dogmas of his time. There are passages enough in
his elaborate treatise which insist on the prevalence of
fraud and melancholia. In his Epistle Dedicatory, which
is addressed to five Yorkshire justices of the peace, he lays
particular stress on the necessity of distinguishing between
impostors and those unfortunate persons who are “under a
mere passive delusion” that they are witches, and warns
the magistrates not to believe impossible confessions.
For all this he deserves honor.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span> Nor do I intend for a
moment to suggest that the queer things (as we regard
them now-a-days) which I have cited are in any manner
discreditable to Webster. He was not exceptionally credulous,
and he belonged to that advanced school of English
physicians who, in the second half of the seventeenth century,
upheld the general theories of Paracelsus and van Helmont
in opposition to the outworn follies of the Galenists or
regulars. He was a man of great erudition, of vast and
varied experience, of uncommon mental gifts, and of passionate
devotion to the truth. I admire him, but I must be
pardoned if I am unable to see how he can be regarded
as a tower of skeptical strength in the great witchcraft
controversy. Even his admissions on the subject of the
fallen angels are enough to destroy the efficiency of his
denial of current notions about witchcraft. Once grant,
as Webster does, that our atmosphere is peopled by legions
upon legions of evil angels, delighting in sin, eager to work
mischief, inimical to God and man, furnished with stores
of acquired knowledge, and able to devise wicked thoughts
and put them into our minds,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span> and it was idle to deny—in
the face of the best philosophic and theological opinion
of the ages—that these demonic beings can make actual
covenants with witches or furnish them with the means
of doing injury to their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>“<dfn>A Witch</dfn>,” according to Glanvill’s definition, “<dfn>is one,
who can do or seems to do strange things, beyond the known
Power of Art and ordinary Nature, by vertue of a Confederacy
with Evil Spirits</dfn>.... The <em>strange things</em> are <em>really</em> performed,
and are not all <em>Impostures</em> and <em>Delusions</em>. The Witch
<em>occasions</em>, but is not the <em>Principal</em> Efficient, she seems to
do it, but the <em>Spirit</em> performs the wonder, sometimes immediately,
as in <em>Transportations</em> and <em>Possessions</em>, sometimes by
applying other Natural Causes, as in raising <em>Storms</em>, and
inflicting <em>Diseases</em>, sometimes using the <em>Witch</em> as an <em>Instrument</em>,
and either by the Eyes or Touch, conveying Malign
Influences: And these things are done by vertue of a
<em>Covenant</em>, or <em>Compact</em> betwixt the <em>Witch</em> and an <em>Evil Spirit</em>.
A <em>Spirit</em>,  <abbr title="namely" >viz.</abbr> an <em>Intelligent Creature</em> of the Invisible World,
whether one of the Evil Angels called <em>Devils</em>, or an Inferiour
<em>Dæmon</em> or <em>Spirit</em>, or a wicked <em>Soul</em> departed; but one that
is able and ready for mischief, and whether altogether
Incorporeal or not, appertains not to this Question.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span>
Glanvill’s book was well known to the Mathers. So
was Webster’s Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span> Could
there be a moment’s doubt which of the two would appeal
the more powerfully to their logical sense? Why, even
we ourselves, if we look at the matter fairly,—taking into
consideration Webster’s whole case, and not merely such
parts of it as accord with our preconceived opinions,—are
forced to admit that Glanvill’s position is much the stronger.</p>

<p>In a well-known passage, in which the intellectual temper
of Massachusetts before 1660 is contrasted with that of
the next generation,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span> our classic New England essayist
remarks that after 1660 the Colonists “sank rapidly into
provincials, narrow in thought, in culture, in creed.” “Such
a pedantic portent as Cotton Mather,” Lowell continues,
“would have been impossible in the first generation; he
was the natural growth of the third.” To discuss these
epigrammatic theses would take us far beyond the limits
of our present subject. One thing, however, must be
said. Pedantry in the latter half of the seventeenth century
was not confined to New England, nor to the ranks of those
who were controversially styled the witchmongers. Meric
Casaubon and Joseph Glanvill were not pedantic, but
John Webster’s Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft—which
in some respects comes very near to being a great
book—is a monument of pedantry, and John Webster
was not a product of New England.</p>

<p>In Thomas Hobbes, whom we may next consider, we
find a philosopher who was altogether incredulous on the
subject of witchcraft. “As for witches,” he writes, “I
think not that their witchcraft is any real power; but yet
that they are justly punished, for the false belief
that they have that they can do such mischief,
joined with their purpose to do it if they can; their
trade being nearer to a new religion than to a craft
or science.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span> This dictum may accord with reason, but
one must admit that it was cold comfort for persons accused
of diabolical arts. And so was the more famous remark
of Selden: “The Law against Witches does not prove there
be any; but it punishes the Malice of those people, that
use such means, to take away mens lives. If one should
profess that by turning his Hat thrice, and crying Buz;
he could take away a man’s life (though in truth he could
do no such thing) yet this were a just Law made by the
State, that whosoever should turn his Hat thrice, and cry
Buz; with an intention to take away a man’s life, shall be put
to death.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span> Bayle, shortly after the beginning of the
eighteenth century, agreed with Selden as to the justice
of putting “sorciers imaginaires” to death.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span> Thomas
Ady, believing (like Scot, to whom he often refers) that
the witches and sorcerers of the Bible were mere cheats,
and that the same is true of all who pretend to similar
arts in modern times, is ready to admit the justice of the
death penalty in cases of fraud. In describing the case
of a certain Master of Arts who was “condemned only for
using himself to the study and practice of the Jugling
craft,” he concludes:—“If he had been a Jugler, or
practiser of that Craft to this end, to withstand the
Prophets when they wrought true miracles, as <em>Pharaohs</em>
Juglers withstood <em>Moses</em>, or if he were one that
practised it to seduce the people after lying delusions,
to magnifie himself as a false Prophet, like <em>Simon
Magus</em> in the <cite>Acts</cite>, or to cause people to ascribe
miraculous power to him, or to seek to the Devil as our
common Deceivers, called good Witches, do, he was
deservedly condemned.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Four dissenters from the current witchcraft dogma we
must pass over in silence—John Wagstaffe, Sir Robert
Filmer, Robert Calef, and Dr. Francis Hutchinson. Calef
came too late to be really significant in our discussion;
Filmer’s tract is a kind of <i lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>, not likely to have
had any influence except upon lawyers;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span> and Wagstaffe’s
book is a quite inconsiderable affair. Yet, in parting,
we must not neglect an odd remark concerning two out of
the four—as well as one other, John Webster, whose lucubrations
we have already criticised—a remark which,
occurring as it does in a work of much learning and unusual
distinction, illustrates in striking fashion the inaccuracy
which we have already had occasion to notice, now and
again, in recent writers who have busied themselves with
the abstruse and complicated subject of witchcraft. President
White, in his Warfare of Science with Theology,
expresses his admiration for Webster, Wagstaffe, and Hutchinson
in the following terms:—“But especially should
honour be paid to the younger men in the Church, who
wrote at length against the whole system: such men as
Wagstaffe and Webster and Hutchinson, who in the humbler
ranks of the clergy stood manfully for truth, with the
certainty that by so doing they were making their own
promotion impossible.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span> Of the three men whom Dr.
White thus commends for renouncing all hope of ecclesiastical
preferment, the first, John Webster, was sixty-seven
years old when he published his book; he had long been
a Non-Conformist, and he describes himself on his title-page
as “Practitioner in Physick.” The second, John Wagstaffe,
was a gentleman of independent means who damaged his
health by “continual bibbing of strong and high tasted
liquors”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span> and who was not in orders at all; the third. Dr.
Francis Hutchinson, was Chaplain in Ordinary to King George
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> when he published his Essay and was advanced to a bishopric
two years after the first edition of the book appeared.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>When in 1692 and 1693, we come to The Enchanted
World (De Betoverde Weereld)<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span> of the Dutch preacher
and theologian Balthasar Bekker, we arrive at a method
of opposing the witch dogma different from anything we
have so far examined. Bekker was fully aware of the
difficulties of his theme, and he had an uncommonly logical
head. His method is perfect. He first sets forth the spiritual
beliefs of the Greeks and Romans and their practices in
the way of sorcery. Then he shows—with an anticipation
of the process so often used by the modern anthropological
school—that the same doctrines and practices are found
among “the pagans of the present day,”—in Northern
Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in America, as well as among
the ancient Jews. The Manichæan heresy, he contends,
was a mélange of pagan and Jewish doctrines. These
doctrines—heathen, Jewish, and Manichæan—early became
current among Christians. Hence, Christians in general
now hold that all sorts of extraordinary happenings are
due to the activity of the devil. Thus Bekker succeeds
in explaining the primary conceptions of modern demonology
and witchcraft as derived from heathen sources.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Bekker’s next task is to define body and spirit, according
to reason and the Bible. Both body and spirit are creatures.
God, being perfect and increate, is neither body nor spirit,
but superior to both. He is called a spirit in the Bible,
simply because there is no better word to express the divine
nature, but that nature is different from what is ordinarily
meant by the term. God being the governor of the world,
we have no ground for believing that there are demigods
(<em>dæmons</em> in the Greek sense) or vice-gods. Apart from the
Scriptures, reason affords us no proof that there are any spirits
except men’s souls. The Scriptures, however, teach that
there are good angels, of whom Michael is the chief, and
bad angels, whose prince is the devil. Beyond this, we
learn practically nothing from the Bible with regard to a
hierarchy of angels or of devils. Demoniacal possession
was a natural disease: it had nothing to do with evil spirits.
Such devils as are mentioned in Scripture are not said to
be vassals of Satan; in many cases we are to understand
the word “devil” merely as a figure of speech for a wicked
man. There is no warrant in Holy Writ for the belief
that Satan can appear to mortals under different forms,
nor for the powers vulgarly ascribed to him and his supposed
demonic household. In particular, there is no scriptural
warrant for the opinion that Satan or his imps can injure
men bodily or even suggest evil thoughts to them. The
devil and the evil angels are damned in hell; they have not
the power to move about in this world. The only way in
which Satan is responsible for the sins which we commit
is through his having brought about the fall of Adam,
so that men are now depraved creatures, prone to sin.
There is no place in the divine government for particular
suggestions to wickedness, made from time to time, since
the Fall, either by Satan himself or by any of his train.
Diabolical influence upon mankind was confined to the
initial temptation in Eden. Since Adam, neither Satan
nor any evil spirit has been active in this world in any manner
whatever, spiritual or corporeal. God rules, and the devil
is not a power to be reckoned with at all. These revolutionary
propositions Bekker proves, to his own satisfaction,
not only from reason, but from the Word of God.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Here at last we have a rational method. Bekker is not
content with half-measures; he lays the axe to the root.
There is a devil, to be sure, and there are fallen angels;
but neither the one nor the other can have anything to do with
the life and actions of mortal men. Practically, then, the
devil is non-existent. We may disregard him entirely.
If Bekker’s propositions are admitted, the stately fabric
of demonology and witchcraft crumbles in an instant.
And nothing less drastic than such propositions will suffice
to make witchcraft illogical or incredible. Bekker’s
argument, we see at once, is utterly different from anything
that his predecessors had attempted.</p>

<p>It now becomes necessary for Bekker to proceed to discuss
those passages in the Bible which appear to justify the
common beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft. These beliefs
are contrary to reason, but, if they rest upon revelation,
they must still be accepted, for Bekker regards himself
as an orthodox Christian of the Dutch Reformed Church.
Accordingly Bekker takes up every scriptural passage
which mentions witches, enchanters, diviners, and the like,
and interprets them all in such a way that they lend no
support to current beliefs in the reality of compacts with
the devil, of magic, or of witchcraft. Whatever magicians
and witches, so-called, may think of their own performances,
there is nothing in Scripture, as interpreted by this bold
and expert theologian and unsurpassed dialectician, to
warrant us in believing in intercourse with Satan, or in
his intervention, with or without the mediation of sorcerers
and witches, in human life as it is to-day.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>But, Bekker hastens to admit, there remains a huge mass
of recent testimony which is regarded by almost everybody
as sufficient to establish the existence of sorcery and witchcraft,
whether such things are recognized in the Bible or
not. To this testimony Bekker devotes the Fourth (and
last) Book of his treatise.</p>

<p>He first points out that all such testimony is prejudiced,
since it comes from persons who have a fixed and, so to
speak, an inherited belief in the truth of the marvels whose
very existence is in question. He then examines a great
body of material, with splendid sobriety and common sense.
This is perhaps the most interesting part of his work to
us,—though in fact it is less original than much of what
precedes, since all opponents of the witch dogma, beginning
with Wier, had attacked the evidence in many particulars,
and since even those scholars and theologians who supported
the dogma most effectively—like Glanvill—had granted
without hesitation that fraud and delusion played a large
part in the accumulation of testimony. Bekker’s treatment
of the subject, however, is better than anything of
the kind that had been written before. Fraud, terror,
hysteria, insanity, illusion of the senses,—due to disease
or to what we should now call hypnotic or semi-hypnotic
conditions,—unknown laws of nature—these are the sources
from which he derives his interpretation of the evidence.
This part of his work, then, has a singularly modern tone,
and gives the author a valid claim to rank as an enlightened
psychologist.</p>

<p>It has seemed advisable to give particular attention
to Bekker’s Enchanted World because of its singular
merits, as well as on account of the distinguished position
which it deservedly holds among the books which oppose
the belief in witchcraft. In strictness, however, we are not
bound to include this work in our survey of seventeenth-century
opinion, since it did not appear in season to exert
any influence on New England at the time of the Salem
prosecution. The first two Books of Bekker’s work were
published in 1691; the second two, which deal specifically
with witchcraft, in 1693. The trouble in Salem began in
February, 1692, and the prosecution collapsed in January,
1693. It is certain that New England scholars knew nothing
about the first two Books when they were engaged in witch
trials, and the last two were not published until the trials
had come to an end. But this matter of dates need not
be insisted on. Even if our ancestors had received advance
sheets of The Enchanted World, their opinions would not,
in all probability, have been in the slightest degree affected.
Indeed, the reception which Bekker’s treatise met with
in his own country is a plain indication of the temper of
the times in this business of witchcraft. The publication
of the first two Books in 1691 was the signal for a storm
of denunciation. The Dutch press teemed with replies
and attacks. Bekker was instantly called to account by
the authorities of the Reformed Church. Complicated
ecclesiastical litigation ensued, with the result that the
Synod of North Holland issued a decree declaring Bekker
“intolerable as teacher in the Reformed Church” and
expelling him from his ministerial office (August 7, 1692).<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
Soon after, the Church Council of Amsterdam voted to
exclude him from the Lord’s Supper (August 17),<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span> and
he was never admitted to communion again. He died on
June 11, 1698.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Another reason for going so fully into Bekker’s arguments
is that they give us an excellent chance to take up a question
which is of cardinal importance in weighing the whole
matter of witchcraft. I refer, of course, to the question
of Biblical exegesis.</p>

<p>If we wish to treat our forefathers fairly, we are required
to criticise the few opponents of the witch dogma in a really
impartial way. We ought not to commend such portions
of their argument as chance to square with our own ideas,
and ignore the rest. We must review their case as a whole,
so as to discover how far it was right or reasonable on the
basis of their own postulates. We must test the correctness
of their premises, as well as the accuracy of their logic.</p>

<p>This process we have gone through with already in several
instances. We have seen that all the opponents of witchcraft
so far examined struggle to maintain a position that
is strategically indefensible, either because they admit
too much, or because they ignore certain difficulties, or
because they are frankly eccentric. It does not help their
case to contend that what they admit or what they ignore
does not signify from our present scientific point of view.
It <em>did</em> signify <em>then</em>. The only man whose argument covers
the ground completely and affords a thorough and consistent
theory on which a seventeenth-century Christian was
logically justified in rejecting witchcraft and demoniacal
possession as facts of everyday experience is Balthasar
Bekker.</p>

<p>Now the truth or falsity of Bekker’s very radical conclusions
hinged—for Bekker himself and for his contemporaries—on
the soundness of his Biblical exegesis. If his way of
disposing of those passages which mention devils and
witches and diviners and familiar spirits is not justifiable—if
the Biblical writers did not mean what he thinks they
meant—then his whole case goes to pieces. In discussing
the witchcraft dogma of the seventeenth century, we must
accept the Bible, for the nonce, as the men of the seventeenth
century (Bekker included) accepted it—as absolutely true
in every detail, as dynamically inspired by the Holy Ghost,
as a complete rule of faith and practice. Modern views
on this subject have no <i lang="la">locus standi</i>.</p>

<p>Now, if we only keep these fundamental principles firmly
in mind, we shall have no doubt as to the outcome. Beyond
question, the Bible affords ample authority for belief in
demoniacal possession, in necromancy, in the ability of
Satan and his cohorts to cause physical phenomena,
and in the power of sorcerers to work miracles.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span> True,
not all the details of the witchcraft dogma rest upon Biblical
authority, but enough of them do so rest to make the case
of those who uphold the traditional opinion substantially
unassailable, except upon the purely arbitrary assumption
that all these wonders, though formerly actual, have ceased
in recent times.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span> Bekker’s exegesis is erroneous in countless
particulars and presents an altogether mistaken view
of Biblical doctrines. As interpreters of the language
of Scripture, the orthodox theologians of his time, who
pinned their faith to witchcraft, were nearer right than he
was. And what is true of Bekker’s exegesis, is equally
true of that followed by all previous opponents of the
witchcraft dogma. My reason for not referring to this
point in criticising their books is obvious. Bekker has
gone farther, and succeeded better, in explaining away
the testimony of Scripture than any of the others. It is
more than fair to them to rest this part of the case upon
his success or failure. If Bekker falls, all of them certainly
fall,—and Bekker falls.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>From our cursory examination of the works put forth
by some of the chief opponents of the witch dogma, it must
be evident that none of these works can have had a very
profound influence on the beliefs of the seventeenth century,—their
function was rather, by keeping discussion alive, to
prepare for the change of sentiment which took place soon
after 1700, in what we are accustomed to call “the age of prose
and reason.” Such an examination as we have given to
these books was necessary to establish the proposition
with which we set out,—that our ancestors in 1692 were
in accord with the practically universal belief of their day.
It has shown more than this, however,—it has demonstrated
that their position was logically and scripturally stronger
than that of their antagonists, provided we judge the
matter (as we are in honor bound to do) on the basis of
those doctrines as to supernaturalism and the inspiration
of the Bible that were alike admitted by both sides. We
may repeat, then, with renewed confidence, the statement
already made:—Our forefathers believed in witchcraft,
not because they were Puritans, not because they were
Colonials, not because they were New Englanders, but
because they were men of their own time and not of ours.</p>

<p>Another point requires consideration if we would arrive
at a just judgment on the Salem upheaval. It is frequently
stated, and still oftener assumed, that the outbreak at
Salem was peculiar in its virulence, or, at all events, in its
intensity. This is a serious error, due, like other misapprehensions,
to a neglect of the history of witchcraft as a whole.
The fact is, the Salem excitement was the opposite of
peculiar,—it was perfectly typical. The European belief in
witchcraft, which our forefathers shared without exaggerating
it, was a constant quantity. It was always present,
and continuously fraught with direful possibilities. But
it did not find expression in a steady and regular succession
of witch trials. On the contrary, it manifested itself at
irregular intervals in spasmodic outbursts of prosecution.
<a id="Basque"></a>Notable examples occurred at Geneva from 1542 to 1546;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span> at

and 1670.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>
In the district of Ortenau, in Baden, witchcraft prosecutions
suddenly broke out, after a considerable interval, in 1627,
and there were seventy-three executions in three years.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span>
From the annals of witchcraft in Great Britain one may
cite the following cases:—1581, at St. Osith’s, in Essex;<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>

is also worthy of attention.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unnecessary for us to consider how much of the
evidence offered at witch trials in England was actually true.
Some of the defendants were pretty bad characters, and it
would be folly to maintain that none of them tried to cause the
sickness or death of their enemies by maltreating clay images
or by other arts which they supposed would avail. Besides,
now and then an injury is testified to which may well have
been inflicted without diabolical aid. Thus Ann Foster,
who was hanged for witchcraft at Northampton in 1674,
confessed that she had set a certain grazier’s barns on fire,
and there is much reason to believe her, for she was under
considerable provocation.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span> As to occult or super-normal
powers and practices, we may leave their discussion to the
psychologists. With regard to this aspect of the Salem
troubles, we must accept, as substantially in accordance
with the facts, the words of Dr. Poole: “No man of any
reputation who lived in that generation, and saw what
transpired at Salem Village and its vicinity, doubted that
there was some influence then exerted which could not
be explained by the known laws of matter or of mind.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span>
Even Thomas Brattle, in speaking of the confessing witches,
many of whom he says he has “again and again seen and
heard,” cannot avoid the hypothesis of demoniacal action.
They are, he feels certain, “deluded, imposed upon, and
under the influence of some evil spirit; and therefore unfit
to be evidences either against themselves, or any one else.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>One common misapprehension to which the historians
of witchcraft are liable comes from their failure to perceive
that the immediate responsibility for actual prosecution
rests frequently, if not in the majority of instances, on the
rank and file of the community or neighborhood. This
remark is not made in exculpation of prosecutors and judges,—for
my purpose in this discussion is not to extenuate anybody’s
offences or to shift the blame from one man’s
shoulders to another. What is intended is simply to remind
the reader of a patent and well-attested fact which is too
often overlooked in the natural tendency of historians
to find some notable personage to whom their propositions,
commendatory or damaging, may be attached. A prosecution
for witchcraft presupposes a general belief among
the common people in the reality of the crime. But this
is not all. It presupposes likewise the existence of a body
of testimony, consisting of the talk of the neighborhood,
usually extending back over a considerable stretch of years,
with regard to certain persons who have the reputation
of being witches, cunning men, and so on. It also presupposes
the belief of the neighborhood that various strange
occurrences,—such as storms, bad crops, plagues of grass-hoppers
and caterpillars, loss of pigs or cattle, cases of
lunacy or hysteria or chorea or wasting sickness,—are
due to the malice of those particular suspects and their
unknown confederates. These strange occurrences, be it
remembered, are not the fictions of a superstitious or distempered
imagination, they are—most of them—things
that have really taken place; they are the <i lang="la">res gestae</i> of the
prosecution, without which it could never have come about,
or, having begun, could never have continued. And
further, in very many instances of prosecution for
witchcraft, there have been among the accused, persons
who believed themselves to be witches,—or who had, at any
rate, pretended to extraordinary powers and—in many
instances—had either used their uncanny reputation to
scare their enemies or to get money by treating diseases
of men and cattle. And finally, the habit of railing and
brawling, of uttering idle but malignant threats, and, on
the other hand, the habit of applying vile epithets—including
that of “witch,”—to one’s neighbors in the heat of anger—customs
far more prevalent in former times than now—also
resulted in the accumulation of a mass of latent or
potential testimony which lay stored up in people’s memories
ready to become kinetic whenever the machinery of the
law should once begin to move.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody will ask for evidence that railing and brawling
went on in colonial New England, that our forefathers
sometimes called each other bad names, or that slander
was a common offence.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span> That suspicion of witchcraft
was rife in various neighborhoods years before the Salem
outbreak, is proved, not only by the records of sporadic
cases that came before the courts,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span> but by some of the
evidence in the Salem prosecution itself.</p>

<p>That the initial responsibility for prosecution usually
rested with the neighborhood or community might further
be shown by many specific pieces of testimony. The terrible
prosecution in Trier toward the close of the sixteenth
century is a case in point. “Since it was commonly
believed,” writes Linden, an eyewitness, “that the continued
failure of the crops for many years was caused by witches
and wizards through diabolical malice, the whole country
rose up for the annihilation of the witches.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span> To like
purpose are the words of the admirable Jesuit, Friedrich
Spee, in the closing chapter of the most powerful and convincing
protest against witch trials ever written—that chapter
which the author begged every magistrate in Germany
to mark and weigh, whether he read the rest of the book
or not:—“Incredible are the superstition, the envy, the
slanders and backbitings, the whisperings and gossip of
the common people in Germany, which are neither punished
by magistrates nor reproved by preachers. These are
the causes that first rouse suspicion of witchcraft. All
the punishments of divine justice with which God has
threatened men in the Holy Scriptures are held to come from
witches. God and nature no longer do anything,—witches,
everything. Hence it is that all demand, with violent outcry,
that the magistracy shall proceed against the witches,
whom only their own tongues have made so numerous.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>As for England, the annals of witchcraft are full of instances
which show where the initial responsibility rests in particular
prosecutions. Two examples will serve as well as many.</p>

<p>Roger North, the distinguished lawyer, who was at Exeter
in 1682, when a famous witch trial occurred,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span> gives a
vivid account of the popular excitement:—<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span> “The women
were very old, decrepit, and impotent, and were brought
to the assizes with as much noise and fury of the rabble
against them as could be shewed on any occasion. The
stories of their acts were in everyone’s mouth, and they
were not content to belie them in the country, but even
in the city where they were to be tried miracles were fathered
upon them, as that the judges’ coach was fixed upon the
castle bridge, and the like. All which the country believed,
and accordingly persecuted the wretched old creatures.
A less zeal in a city or kingdom hath been the overture of
defection and revolution, and if these women had been
acquitted, it was thought that the country people would
have committed some disorder.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Wenham"></a>Our second example is a very notable case, which occurred
in 1712,—that of Jane Wenham, the last witch condemned
to death in England. Jane Wenham had a dispute with
a neighboring farmer, who called her a witch. She complained
to the local magistrate, Sir Henry Chauncy. He
referred the dispute to the parson of the parish, who, after
hearing both sides, admonished the wranglers to live at
peace and sentenced the farmer to pay Jane a shilling.
The old crone was not pleased. Shortly after, one of the
clergyman’s servants, a young woman, was strangely
afflicted. Jane was brought to trial. Every effort seems
to have been made by the court to put a stop to the affair,
but the local feeling was so strong, and the witnesses and
complainants were so many (including the clergymen of
two parishes) that nothing could be done. The official
who drew up the indictment endeavored to make the whole
affair ridiculous by refusing to use any other phraseology in
describing the alleged crime than “conversing with the
devil in the form of a cat.” But the well-meant device
only intensified the feeling against the witch. Mr. Justice
Powell, who presided, did what he could to induce the
jury to acquit, but in vain. They brought in a verdict
of guilty, and he was obliged to pass sentence of death.
He suspended the execution of the sentence, however,
and secured the royal pardon,—to the intense indignation
of the neighborhood. Here we have a jury of the vicinage,
accurately reflecting the local sentiment, and insisting on
carrying out its belief in witchcraft to the bitter end, despite
all that the judge could do.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span> It is well to note that the
clergymen involved in the prosecution were not New England
Puritans, and that the whole affair took place just
ten years after the last execution of a witch in Massachusetts.
Of itself, this incident might suffice to silence
those who ascribe the Salem outbreak to the influence of
certain distinguished men, as well as those who maintain
that the New Englanders were more superstitious than
their fellow-citizens at home, that their Puritanism was
somehow to blame for it, and that witchcraft was practically
dead in the Mother Country when the Salem outbreak
took place.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Thomas Wright—never to be mentioned without
honor—speaks of the New England troubles as “exemplifying
the horrors and the absurdities of the witchcraft
persecutions more than anything that had occurred in the old
world,”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span> and Dr. G. H. Moore,—in an important article
on The Bibliography of Witchcraft in Massachusetts—declares
that the Salem outbreak “was the <em>epitome</em> of witchcraft!
whose ghastly records may be challenged to produce
any parallel for it in the world’s history!”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span> In further
refutation of such reckless statements I need add but
a single instance. In 1596 there was an outbreak of some
pestilence or other in Aberdeen. The populace ascribed
the disease to the machinations of a family long suspected
of witchcraft. A special commission was appointed by
the Privy Council, “and before April 1597, twenty-three
women and one man had been burnt, one woman had died
under the torture, one had hanged herself in prison, and four
others who were acquitted on the capital charge, were yet
branded on the cheek and banished from the sheriffdom.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a very special reason why troubles with the
powers of darkness were to be expected in New England—a
reason which does not hold good for Great Britain or,
indeed, for any part of Western Europe. I refer, of course,
to the presence of a considerable heathen population—the
Indians. These were universally supposed to be devil-worshippers—not
only by the Colonists but by all the
rest of the world—for paganism was held to be nothing
but Satanism.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span> Cotton Mather and the Jesuit fathers
of Canada were at one on this point.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span> The religious
ceremonies of the Indians were, as we know, in large part
an invocation of spirits, and their powwows, or medicine
men, supposed themselves to be wizards,—<em>were</em> wizards,
indeed, so far as sorcery is possible.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span> The Colonial
government showed itself singularly moderate, however,
in its attitude toward Indian practices of a magical character.
Powwowing was, of course, forbidden wherever the jurisdiction
of the white men held sway, but it was punishable
by fine only, nor was there any idea of inflicting the extreme
penalty<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span>—although the offence undoubtedly came under
the Mosaic law, so often quoted on the title-pages of books
on witchcraft, “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”</p>

<p>The existence of all these devil-worshipping neighbors
was a constant reminder of the possibility of danger from
witchcraft. One is surprised, therefore, to find that there
was no real outbreak until so late in the century. It argues
an uncommon degree of steadiness and common sense
among our forefathers that they held off the explosion so
long. Yet even this delay has been made to count against
them, as if, by 1692, they ought to have known better,
even if they might have been excusable some years before.
In point of fact, the New Englanders, as we have seen,
made an end of trying witches nearly ten years earlier
than their English fellow-citizens. But we shall come
back to this question of dates presently.</p>

<p>Much has been written of the stupendous and criminal
foolishness of our ancestors in admitting “spectral evidence”
at the Salem trials. Nothing, of course, can be said in
defence of such evidence in itself; but a great deal might
be said in defence of our ancestors on this score. The
fact is,—and it should never be lost sight of,—there was
nothing strange in their admitting such evidence. It
was a matter of course that they should admit it.
To do so indeed, was one of the best established of
all legal principles. Spectral evidence was admitted,
for example, in England, either in examinations or
in actual trials, in 1593,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span>

> 1680,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span>
 1683.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span> Even Chief Justice Holt,
whose honorable record in procuring the acquittal of every
witch he tried is well-known,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span> did not exclude spectral
evidence: it was offered and admitted in at least two of his
cases—in 1695 and 1696<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span>—both later than the last witch
trial in Massachusetts. In the 1697 edition of that very popular
manual, Michael Dalton’s Country Justice, spectral
evidence (“Their Apparition to the Sick Party in his Fits”) is
expressly mentioned as one of the proofs of witchcraft.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
What may fairly be called spectral evidence was admitted by
Mr. Justice Powell, anxious as he was to have the defendant
acquitted, in the trial of Jane Wenham in 1712.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></span> The question,
then, was not whether such evidence might be heard, but
what weight was to be attached to it. Thus, in Sir Matthew
Hale’s case, Mr. Serjeant Keeling was “much unsatisfied”
with such testimony, affirming that, if it were allowed to
pass for proof, “no person whatsoever can be in safety.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span>
He did not aver that it should not have been admitted,
but only protested against regarding it as decisive, and in
the end he seems to have become convinced of the guilt
of the defendants.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span> It is, therefore, nothing against
our ancestors that they heard such evidence, for they were
simply following the invariable practice of the English
courts. On the other hand, it is much to their credit that
they soon began to suspect it, and that, having taken advice,
they decided, in 1693, to allow it no further weight. We
may emphasize the folly of spectral evidence as much as
we like.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span> Only let us remember that in so doing we are
attacking, not New England in 1692, but Old England
from 1593 to 1712. When, on the other hand, we distribute
compliments to those who refused to allow such evidence
to constitute full proof, let us not forget that with the name
of Chief Justice Holt we must associate those of certain
Massachusetts worthies whom I need not specify. It is
not permissible to blame our ancestors for an error of
judgment that they shared with everybody, and then to
refuse them commendation for a virtue which they shared
with a very few wise heads in England. That would be
to proceed on the principle of “heads I win, tails you lose,”—a
method much followed by Matthew Hopkins and his
kind, but of doubtful propriety in a candid investigation
of the past. We shall never keep our minds clear on the
question of witchcraft in general, and of the Salem witchcraft
in particular, until we stop attacking and defending
individual persons.</p>

<p><a id="Holt"></a>Sir John Holt, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench from
1682 to 1710, has a highly honorable name in the annals
of English witchcraft. A dozen or twenty cases came before
him, and in every instance the result was an acquittal.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span>
Chief Justice Holt deserves all the credit he has received;
but it must be carefully noted that his example cannot
be cited to the shame and confusion of our ancestors in
Massachusetts, for most of his cases,—all but one, so far
as I can ascertain,—occurred after the release of the New
England prisoners and the abandonment of the prosecution
here. As to that single case of acquittal, we must not
forget that there were also acquittals in New England,—in
1674 and 1676, for example.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span> As to acquittals in England
<em>after</em> 1693, let it be remembered that there were <em>no
trials at all for witchcraft</em> in New England subsequent to
that year. If Chief Justice Holt is to be commended for
procuring the acquittal of a dozen witches between 1693
and 1702, what is to be ascribed to our forefathers for bringing
no cases to trial during that period?</p>

<p>The most remarkable things about the New England prosecution
were the rapid return of the community to its habitually
sensible frame of mind and the frank public confession
of error made by many of those who had been implicated.
These two features, and especially the latter, are without
a parallel in the history of witchcraft. It seems to be
assumed by most writers that recantation and an appeal
to heaven for pardon were the least that could have been
expected of judge and jury. In fact, as I have just ventured
to suggest, no action like Samuel Sewall’s on the part of
a judge and no document like that issued by the repentant
Massachusetts jurymen have yet been discovered in the
witch records of the world.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is not for the sake of lauding their penitential exercises
that I lay stress upon the unexampled character of
our forefathers’ action. There is another aspect from which
the outcome of the Salem trials ought to be regarded.
They fell at a critical moment, when witchcraft was, for
whatever reason, soon to become a crime unknown to the
English courts. They attracted attention instantly in
the Mother Country.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></span> Can there be any question that
the sensational recovery of the Province from its attack
of prosecuting zeal, accompanied as that recovery was by
retraction and by utterances of deep contrition, had a
profound effect in England? The mere dropping of the
prosecution would not have had this effect. In 1597, James
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, alarmed at the extent to which witch trials were going in
Scotland, revoked all the existing special commissions that
were engaged in holding trials for this offence.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span> But
the evil was soon worse than ever. What was efficacious
in the New England instance was the unheard-of action
of judge and jury in recanting. This made the Salem
troubles the best argument conceivable in the hands of
those reformers who, soon after 1700, began to make actual
headway in their opposition to the witch dogma.</p>

<p>I am not reasoning <i lang="la">a priori</i>. By common consent one
of the most effective arraignments of the superstition
that we are discussing is the Historical Essay on Witchcraft
of Dr. Francis Hutchinson, which appeared in 1718.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span>
Now Hutchinson, who gives much space to the New England
trials, refers to Sewall’s action, and prints the recantation
of the jurors in full. Nor does he leave in us doubt
as to the purpose for which he adduces these testimonies.
“And those Towns,” he writes, “having regained their
Quiet; and this Case being of that Nature, that Facts and
Experience are of more weight than meer rational Arguments;
it will be worth our while to observe some Passages
that happened after this Storm, when they had Time to
look back on what had passed.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of these considerations, one
fact cannot be assailed. In prosecuting witches, our forefathers
acted like other men in the seventeenth century.
In repenting and making public confession, they acted like
themselves. Their fault was the fault of their time; their
merit is their own.</p>

<p>We must not leave this subject without looking into the
question of numbers and dates. The history of the Salem
Witchcraft is, to all intents and purposes, the sum total
of witchcraft history in the whole of Massachusetts for a
century. From the settlement of the country, of course,
our fathers believed in witchcraft, and cases came before
the courts from time to time, but, outside of the Salem
outbreak, not more than half-a-dozen executions can be
shown to have occurred. It is not strange that there should
have been witch trials. It is inconceivable that the Colony
should have passed through its first century without some
special outbreak of prosecution—inconceivable, that is to say,
to one who knows what went on in England and the rest
of Europe during that time. The wonderful thing is,
not that an outbreak of prosecution occurred, but that it
did not come sooner and last longer.</p>

<p>From the first pranks of the afflicted children in Mr.
Parris’s house (in February, 1692) to the collapse of the
prosecution in January, 1693, was less than a year. During
the interval twenty persons had suffered death, and two
are known to have died in jail.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></span> If to these we add the
six sporadic cases that occurred in Massachusetts before
1692, there is a total of twenty-eight; but this is the whole
reckoning, not merely for a year or two but for a complete
century. The concentration of the trouble in Massachusetts
within the limits of a single year has given a wrong
turn to the thoughts of many writers. This concentration
makes the case more conspicuous, but it does not make
it worse. On the contrary, it makes it better. It is astonishing
that there should have been only half-a-dozen executions
for witchcraft in Massachusetts before 1692, and
equally astonishing that the delusion, when it became
acute, should have raged for but a year, and that but twenty-two
persons should have lost their lives. The facts are
distinctly creditable to our ancestors,—to their moderation
and to the rapidity with which their good sense could
reassert itself after a brief eclipse.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us compare figures a little. For Massachusetts the
account is simple—twenty-eight victims in a century. No
one has ever made an accurate count of the executions
in England during the seventeenth century, but they must
have mounted into the hundreds.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span> Matthew Hopkins,
the Witch-finder General, brought at least two hundred
to the gallows from 1645 to 1647.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span> In Scotland
the number of victims was much larger. The most
conscientiously moderate estimate makes out a total
of at least 3,400 between the years 1580 and 1680, and
the computer declares that future discoveries in the
way of records may force us to increase this figure very
much.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span> On the Continent many thousands suffered
death in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Mannhardt
reckons the victims from the fourteenth to the seventeenth
century at millions,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span> and half a million is thought
to be a moderate estimate. In Alsace, a hundred and
thirty-four witches and wizards were burned in 1582 on
one occasion, the execution taking place on the 15th, 19th,
24th, and 28th of October.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span> Nicholas Remy (Remigius)
of Lorraine gathered the materials for his work on the
Worship of Demons,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span> published in 1595, from the trials
of some 900 persons whom he had sentenced to death in
the fifteen years preceding. In 1609, de Lancre and his
associate are said to have condemned 700 in the Basque
country in four months.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span> The efforts of the Bishop of
Bamberg from 1622 to 1633 resulted in six hundred executions;
the Bishop of Würzburg, in about the same period,
put nine hundred persons to death.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span> These figures,
which might be multiplied almost indefinitely,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span> help us
to look at the Salem Witchcraft in its true proportions,—as
a very small incident in the history of a terrible superstition.</p>

<p>These figures may perhaps be attacked as involving a
fallacious comparison, inasmuch as we have not attempted
to make the relative population of New England and the
several districts referred to a factor in the equation. Such
an objection, if anybody should see fit to make it, is easily
answered by other figures. The total number of victims
in Massachusetts from the first settlement to the end of
the seventeenth century was, as we have seen, twenty-eight,—or
thirty-four for the whole of New England. Compare
the following figures, taken from the annals of Great Britain
and Scotland alone. In 1612, ten witches were executed
belonging to a single district of Lancashire.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span> In 1645 twenty-nine
witches were condemned at once in a single Hundred in
Essex,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span> eighteen
 were hanged at once at Bury in Suffolk<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span>
“and a hundred and twenty more were to have been tried,
but a sudden movement of the king’s troops in that direction
obliged the judges to adjourn the session.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span> Under date
of July 26, 1645, Whitelocke records that “20 Witches in
Norfolk were executed”,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span> and again, under April 15,
1650, that “at a little Village within two Miles [of Berwick]
two Men and three Women were burnt for Witches, and
nine more were to be burnt, the Village consisting of but
fourteen Families, and there were as many witches” and
further that “twenty more were to be burnt within six
Miles of that place.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span> If we pass over to the Continent,
the numbers are appalling. Whether, then, we take the
computation in gross or in detail, New England emerges
from the test with credit.</p>

<p>The last execution for witchcraft in Massachusetts took
place in 1692, as we have seen; indeed, twenty of the total
of twenty-six cases fell within the limits of that one
year. There were no witch trials in New England in the
eighteenth century. The annals of Europe are not so clear.
Six witches were burned in Renfrewshire in 1697.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></span>
In England, Elinor Shaw and Mary Phillips, “two notorious
witches,” were put to death at Northampton in 1705
(or 1706).<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span> In 1712 Jane Wenham was condemned to
death for witchcraft, but she was pardoned.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span> Two
clergymen of the Church of England, as well as a Bachelor
of Arts of Cambridge,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span> gave evidence against her. Just
before the arrest of Jane Wenham, Addison in the Spectator
for July 11, 1711, had expressed the creed of a well-bred and
sensible man of the world: “I believe in general that there
is, and has been such a thing as Witchcraft; but at the same
time can give no Credit to any particular Instance of it.”
Blackstone, it will be remembered, subscribed to the
same doctrine, making particular reference to Addison.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
Prompted, one may conjecture, by the stir which the
Wenham trial made, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. Boys, of Coggeshall
Magna, in Essex, transcribed, in this same year, from
his memoranda, A Brief Account of the Indisposition
of the Widow Coman. This case had occurred in his own
parish in 1699, and he had given it careful investigation.
Both in 1699, when he jotted down the facts, and in 1712,
Mr. Boys was clearly of the opinion that his unfortunate
parishioner was a witch. His narrative, which remained
in manuscript until 1901,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span>
may be profitably compared
with Cotton Mather’s account of his visit to Margaret
Rule in 1693.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span> Such a comparison will not work to the
disadvantage of the New England divine. Incidentally
it may be mentioned that the mob “swam” the widow
Coman several times, and that “soon after, whether by
the cold she got in the water or by some other means, she
fell very ill, and dyed.” Let it not be forgotten that this
was six years after the end of the witchcraft prosecutions
in Massachusetts. In 1705 a supposed witch was murdered
by a mob at Pittenween in Scotland.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span> In 1730, another
alleged witch succumbed to the water ordeal in Somersetshire.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
The English and Scottish statutes against witchcraft
were repealed in 1736,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span> but in that same year Joseph
Juxson, vicar, preached at Twyford, in Leicestershire, a
Sermon upon Witchcraft, occasioned by a late Illegal
Attempt to discover Witches by Swimming,<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span> and in 1751
Ruth Osborne, a reputed witch, was murdered by a mob
in Hertfordshire.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span> The last execution for witchcraft
in Germany took place in 1775. In Spain the last witch
was burned in 1781, In Switzerland Anna Göldi was
beheaded in 1782 for bewitching the child of her master,
a physician. In Poland two women were burned as late
as 1793.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>That the belief in witchcraft is still pervasive among the
peasantry of Europe, and to a considerable extent among
the foreign-born population in this country, is a matter of
common knowledge.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span> Besides, spiritualism and kindred
delusions have taken over, under changed names, many
of the phenomena, real and pretended, which would have
been explained as due to witchcraft in days gone by.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Why did the Salem outbreak occur? Of course there
were many causes—some of which have already suggested
themselves in the course of our discussion. But one fact
should be borne in mind as of particular importance. The
belief in witchcraft, as we have already had occasion to
remark, was a constant quantity; but outbreaks of prosecution
came, in England—and, generally speaking, elsewhere—spasmodically,
at irregular intervals. If we look at Great
Britain for a moment, we shall see that such outbreaks
are likely to coincide with times of political excitement
or anxiety. Thus early in Elizabeth’s reign, when everything
was more or less unsettled, Bishop Jewel, whom all
historians delight to honor, made a deliberate and avowed
digression, in a sermon before the queen, in order to warn
her that witchcraft was rampant in the realm, to inform
her (on the evidence of his own eyes) that her subjects
were being injured in their goods and their health, and
to exhort her to enforce the law.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span> The initial zeal of
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> in the prosecution of witches stood in close connection
with the trouble he was having with his turbulent
cousin Francis Bothwell.<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span> The operations of Matthew
Hopkins (in 1645-1647) were a mere accompaniment to
the tumult of the Civil War; the year in which they began
was the year of Laud’s execution and of the Battle of
Naseby. The Restoration was followed by a fresh outbreak
of witch prosecution,—mild in England, though
far-reaching in its consequences, but very sharp in Scotland.</p>

<p>With facts like these in view, we can hardly regard it
as an accident that the Salem witchcraft marks a time
when the Colony was just emerging from a political struggle
that had threatened its very existence. For several years
men’s minds had been on the rack. The nervous condition
of public feeling is wonderfully well depicted in a letter
written in 1688 by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joshua Moodey in Boston
to Increase Mather, then in London as agent of the Colony.
The Colonists are much pleased by the favor with which
Mather has been received, but they distrust court promises.
They are alarmed by a report that Mather and his associates
have suffered “a great slurr” on account of certain over-zealous
actions. Moodey rejoices in the death of Robert
Mason, “one of the worst enemies that you &amp; I &amp; Mr.
Morton had in these parts.” Then there are the Indians:—“The
cloud looks very dark and black upon us, &amp; wee are
under very awfull circumstances, which render an Indian
Warr terrible to us.” The Colonists shudder at a rumor
that John Palmer, one of Andros’s Council, is to come over
as Supreme Judge, and know not how to reconcile it with
the news of the progress their affairs have been making
with the King. And finally, the writer gives an account
of the case of Goodwin’s afflicted children, which, as we
know, was a kind of prologue to the Salem outbreak:—“Wee
have a very strange th[ing] among us, which we know
not what to make of, except it bee Witchcraft, as we think
it must needs bee.”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span> Clearly, there would have been
small fear, in 1692, of a plot on Satan’s part to destroy the
Province, if our forefathers had not recently encountered
other dangers of a more tangible kind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In conclusion, I may venture to sum up, in the form of
a number of brief theses, the main results at which we appear
to have arrived in our discussion of witchcraft:—</p>

<p>1. The belief in witchcraft is the common heritage of
humanity. It is not chargeable to any particular time,
or race, or form of religion.</p>

<p>2. Witchcraft in some shape or other is still credited
by a majority of the human race.</p>

<p>3. The belief in witchcraft was practically universal
in the seventeenth century, even among the educated;
with the mass of the people it was absolutely universal.</p>

<p>4. To believe in witchcraft in the seventeenth century
was no more discreditable to a man’s head or heart than
it was to believe in spontaneous generation or to be ignorant
of the germ theory of disease.</p>

<p>5. The position of the seventeenth century believers
in witchcraft was logically and theologically stronger
than that of the few persons who rejected the current
belief.</p>

<p>6. The impulse to put a witch to death comes from the
instinct of self-preservation. It is no more cruel or
otherwise blameworthy, in itself, than the impulse to put
a murderer to death.</p>

<p>7. The belief in witchcraft manifests itself, not in steady
and continuous prosecution, but in sudden outbreaks
occurring at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>8. Such outbreaks are not symptoms of extraordinary
superstition or of a peculiarly acute state of unreason. They
are due, like other panics, to a perturbed condition of the
public mind. Hence they are likely to accompany, or to
follow, crises in politics or religion.</p>

<p>9. The responsibility for any witch prosecution rests
primarily on the community or neighborhood as a whole,
not on the judge or the jury.</p>

<p>10. No jury, whether in a witch trial or in any other
case, can be more enlightened than the general run of the
vicinage.</p>

<p>11. Many persons who have been executed for witchcraft
have supposed themselves to be guilty and have
actually been guilty in intent.</p>

<p>12. Practically every person executed for witchcraft
believed in the reality of such a crime, whether he supposed
himself to be guilty of it or not.</p>

<p>13. The witch beliefs of New England were brought
over from the Mother Country by the first settlers.</p>

<p>14. Spectral evidence had been admitted in the examinations
and trials of witches in England for a hundred years
before the Salem prosecutions took place.</p>

<p>15. Trials, convictions, and executions for witchcraft
occurred in England after they had come to an end in Massachusetts,
and they occurred on the Continent a hundred
years later than that time.</p>

<p>16. Spectral evidence was admitted in English witch
trials after such trials had ceased in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>17. The total number of persons executed for witchcraft
in New England from the first settlement to the end of
the century is inconsiderable, especially in view of what
was going on in Europe.</p>

<p>18. The public repentance and recantation of judge and
jury in Massachusetts have no parallel in the history of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>19. The repentance and recantation came at a time
which made them singularly effective arguments in the
hands of the opponents of the witch dogma in England.</p>

<p>20. The record of New England in the matter of witchcraft
is highly creditable, when considered as a whole and
from the comparative point of view.</p>

<p>21. It is easy to be wise after the fact,—especially when
the fact is two hundred years old.</p>

That the New Englanders brought their views on demonology and
witchcraft with them from the Mother Country is a self-evident
proposition, but it may be worth while to refer to a striking
instance of the kind. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Higginson, writing from Salem
to Increase Mather in 1683, sends him two cases for his Illustrious
Providences,—both of which he “believes to be certain.” The first
is an account of how a mysterious stranger, thought to be the devil,
once lent a conjuring book to “godly Mr. [Samuel] Sharp, who was
Ruling Elder of the Church of Salem allmost 30 years.” The incident
took place when Sharp was a young man in London. The second narrative
Mr. Higginson “heard at Gilford from a godly old man yet living. He
came from Essex, and hath been in N. E. about 50 years.” It is a
powerfully interesting legend of the Faust type, localised in Essex.
In a postscript Mr. Higginson adds, “I had credible information of one
in Leicestershire, in the time of the Long Parliament, that gave his
soul to the Divel, upon condition to be a Famous Preacher, which he
was for a time, &amp;c., but I am imperfect in the story.” (Mather Papers,
<abbr title="Massachusetts Historical Society">Mass. Hist. Soc.</abbr> Collections, 4th Series, <abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr>, 285-287). See also the
cases of witchcraft before 1692 collected in S. G. Drake’s Annals of
Witchcraft in New England. Dr. Poole is far nearer the truth in saying
that “the New-England colonists had no views concerning witchcraft
and diabolical agency which they did not bring with them from the Old
World” (Witchcraft in Boston, in Winsor, Memorial History of Boston,
<abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 131) than President White is when he remarks that “the life of the
early colonists in New England was such as to give rapid growth to the
germs of the doctrine of possession brought from the mother country”
(Warfare of Science with Theology, <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 145).</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_2"><span class="muchsmaller">[2]</span></a> A masterly short account of the various elements which made up the
fully developed doctrine of witchcraft as it was held during the three
centuries of especial prosecution (1400-1700), and of the sources from
which these elements were derived, may be found in the first chapter of
Joseph Hansen’s Zauberwahn, Inquisition und Hexenprozess im Mittelalter
(Munich and Leipzig, 1900). A learned and able essay by Professor
George L. Burr, The Literature of Witchcraft, reprinted from the
Papers of the American Historical Association, New York, 1890, should
also be consulted. Professor Burr emphasises the sound and necessary
distinction between witchcraft and magic. But he seems to go too far
in his insistence on this distinction as vital in the history of
witchcraft: “Magic itself is actual and universal. But witchcraft never
was. It was but a shadow, a nightmare: the nightmare of a religion,
the shadow of a dogma. Less than five centuries saw its birth, its
vigor, its decay” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 238; <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 38 of reprint). This statement is true
if by witchcraft is meant (and this is Professor Burr’s sense) the
fully developed and highly complicated system set forth in the Malleus
Maleficarum and in Del Rio’s Disquisitiones Magicae—what Hansen (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
35) calls <span lang="de">“der verhängnisvolle Sammelbegriff des Hexenwesens,”</span>—which
was not possible until scholasticism had schematised the diversified
elements of belief in magic and demonology and sorcery and
devil-worship which Christian theology and Christian superstition
had derived from the most various sources—from Judaism, classical
antiquity, Neo-Platonism, and the thousand-and-one beliefs of pagan
converts. But, important as this fully developed system was—and true
though it may be that without the schematising influence of scholastic
philosophy the witch-prosecution which was epidemic in Europe from
1400 to 1700 could hardly have taken place—we should never forget
that the essential element in witchcraft is <dfn>maleficium</dfn>—the
working of harm to the bodies and goods of one’s fellow-men by means
of evil spirits or of strange powers derived from intercourse with
such spirits. This belief in <i lang="la">maleficium</i> was once universal; it
was rooted and grounded in the minds of the people before they became
Christians; it is still the creed of most savages and of millions of
so-called civilised men. Throughout the history of witchcraft (in
whatever sense we understand that word), it remained the ineradicable
thing,—the solid foundation, unshakably established in popular
belief, for whatever superstructure might be reared by the ingenuity
of jurisconsults, philosophers, theologians, or inquisitors. Without
this popular belief in <i lang="la">maleficium</i>, the initial suspicions and
complaints which form the basis and starting-point of all prosecutions
would have been impossible and inconceivable. <em>With</em> this popular
belief, the rest was easy. The error into which Professor Burr has
fallen is due, no doubt, to his keeping his eye too exclusively on
the Continent, where the prosecutions were most extensive, where, in
truth, the fully developed system was most prevalent, and where the
inquisitorial methods of procedure give to the witch-trials a peculiar
air of uniformity and theological schematism. Thus he has been led,
like many other historians, to over-emphasise the learned or literary
side of the question. For us, however, as the descendants of Englishmen
and as students of the history of English colonies in America, it is
necessary to fix our attention primarily on the Mother Country. And,
if we do this, we cannot fail to perceive that the obstinate belief of
the common people in <i lang="la">maleficium</i>—a belief which, it cannot be
too often repeated, is not the work of theologians but the universal
and quasi-primitive creed of the human race—is the root of the whole
matter. (On savage witchcraft see the anthropologists <i lang="la">passim</i>.
Good examples may be found in Karl von den Steinen, <span lang="de">Unter den
Naturvölkern Brasiliens</span>, 1894, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 339 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>)</p>

<p class="footnote">On <dfn>maleficium</dfn> see especially Hansen, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 9 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr> Nothing could
be truer than his words:—<span lang="de">“Wie viel auch immer im Laufe der Zeit in
den Begriff der Zauberei und Hexerei hineingetragen worden ist, so ist
doch sein Kern stets das Maleficium geblieben. Aus dieser Vorstellung
erwächst die angstvolle Furcht der Menschen und das Verlangen nach
gesetzlichem Schutze und blutig strenger Strafe; von ihr hat die
strafrechtliche Behandlung dieses Wahns ihren Ausgang genommen”</span> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
9). <span lang="de">“Das Maleficium, mit Ausnahme des Wettermachens, ist ohne alle
Unterbrechung von der kirchlichen und bis in das 17. Jahrhundert auch
von der staatlichen Autorität als Realität angenommen, seine Kraft ist
nie ernstlich in Abrede gestellt worden; es bildet den roten Faden
auch durch die Geschichte der strafrechtlichen Verfolgung”</span> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13).
Everybody knows that the most convincing evidence of witchcraft—short
of confession or of denunciation by a confederate—was held to be the
<i lang="la">damnum minatum</i> and the <i lang="la">malum secutum</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote">The difference between England and the Continent in the development of
the witchcraft idea and in the history of prosecution is recognised by
Hansen (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34, note 1). President White, like Professor Burr, has his
eye primarily on the Continent (Warfare of Science with Theology, 1896,
I, 350 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>). His treatment of demoniacal possession, however, is much
to our purpose (<abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 97 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>, 135 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_3"><span class="muchsmaller">[3]</span></a> King James’s connection with the history of witchcraft almost
deserves a monograph for it has never been adequately discussed,
and various misconceptions on the subject are afloat. Thus Mr. H.
M. Doughty, in an interesting but one-sided essay on Witchcraft and
Christianity (Blackwood’s Magazine, March, 1898, <abbr title="163">CLXIII</abbr>, 388), remarks
that “the new King James had long lived in abject fear of witches”—an
assertion that he would find it impossible to prove, even if it were
true, as it seems not to be.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_4"><span class="muchsmaller">[4]</span></a> The act of 5 <abbr title="Elizabeth chapter">Eliz. c.</abbr> 16 (after reciting that 33 Henr. <abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr>. c. 8
had been repealed by 1 <abbr title="Edward Six chapter">Edw. VI. c.</abbr> 12) prescribes the penalty of death
for witchcraft which destroys life, imprisonment for that which causes
bodily injury (death for the second offence); in certain harmless kinds
of sorcery (such as accompanied the search for treasure or stolen
goods) the second offence is punished by imprisonment for life. 1 <abbr title="James One chapter">Jac.
I. c.</abbr> 12 follows 5 <abbr title="Elizabeth chapter">Eliz. c.</abbr> 16 in the main. Its chief differences
are,—greater detail in defining witchcraft; the insertion of a passage
about digging up dead bodies for purposes of sorcery; death for the
first offence in cases of witchcraft which causes bodily injury; death
for the second offence in treasure-seeking sorcery and the like. Before
one pronounces the new statute much severer than the old, it would be
well to examine the practical operation of the two. In particular, one
ought to determine how many witches were executed under the law of
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> who would not have been subject to the death penalty under
the law of Elizabeth. This is not the place for such an examination.
On treasure-seeking sorcery see the learned and entertaining essay of
Dr. Augustus Jessopp, Hill-Digging and Magic (in his Random Roaming and
Other Papers, 1893).</p>

and Witchcraft, <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, 261 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr> Hale’s opinion was regarded as settling
the law beyond peradventure. It is quoted, in A True and Impartial
Relation of the Informations against Three Witches ... Assizes holden
for the County of Devon at the Castle of Exon, <abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 14, 1682 (London,
1682), Address to the Reader. For Roger North’s comments on the Exeter
case, see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 192, below. A Collection of Modern Relations of Matters of
Fact, concerning Witches &amp; Witchcraft, Part <abbr title="One">I</abbr> (London, 1693), contains
“A Discourse concerning the great Mercy of God, in preserving us from
the Power and Malice of <em>Evil Angels</em>. <em>Written by Sir</em> Matt.
Hale <em>at Cambridge</em> 26 <abbr title="March">Mar.</abbr> 1661. <em>Upon occasion of a Tryal of
certain Witches before him the Week before at St.</em> Edmund’s Bury.”
The date is wrong (1661 should be 1664), but the trial is identified
with that which we are considering by the anonymous compiler of the
Collection in the following words: “There is a Relation of it in
print, written by his Marshal, which I suppose is very true, though
to the best of my Memory, not so compleat, as to some observable
Circumstances, as what he related to me at his return from that
Circuit.” The date of the trial is given as “the Tenth day of March,
1664” on the title-page of the report (A Tryal of Witches) and on page
1 as “the Tenth day of March, in the Sixteenth Year of the Reign of ...
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>” On page 57 the year is misprinted “1662.” Howell’s State
Trials, <abbr title="Six">VI</abbr>, 647, 687, makes it 1665, but 16 Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> corresponds to
Jan. 30, 1664—Jan. 29, 1665: hence 1664 is right. The (unfinished)
Discourse just mentioned must not be confused with Hale’s Motives to
Watchfulness, in reference to the Good and Evil Angels, which may be
found in his Contemplations Moral and Divine, London, 1682 (licensed
1675-6), Part <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 67 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr></p>

be quoted, not because it is just, but because it might conceivably
be brought forward by somebody in rebuttal of this proposition:—“Mr.
<cite>Joseph Glanvill</cite> of <em>Lincoln</em> College, <em>Oxon</em>. Taking
the Degree of M. A. in the beginning of 1658, was about that Time made
Chaplain to old <em>Francis Rous</em>; one of <em>Oliver</em>’s Lords,
and Provost of <em>Eaton</em> College.—He became a great Admirer of
Mr. <em>Richard Baxter</em>, and a zealous Person for a Commonwealth.
After his Majesty’s Restauration he turn’d about, became a
Latitudinarian,—Rector of <em>Bath</em>, Prebendary of <em>Worcester</em>,
and Chaplain to the King” (White Kennet, An Historical Register, 1744,

<a href="#fnanchor_31"><span class="muchsmaller">[31]</span></a> Meric Casaubon was born in 1599 and died in 1671. His learned,
lively, and vastly entertaining work, A Treatise concerning
Enthusiasme, as it is an Effect of Nature: but is mistaken by many for
either Divine Inspiration, or Diabolicall Possession, appeared in 1655,
and in a “Second edition: revised, and enlarged” in 1656. It shows
an open mind and a temper rather skeptical than credulous. Passages
of interest in our present discussion may be found on <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 37-41, 44,
49, 94-95, 100, 118, 174 (Quakers), 286, of the second edition. Of
particular significance is the Doctor’s account of his visit to a man
who was thought to be possessed but whom he believed to be suffering
from some bodily distemper (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 97 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>). Casaubon’s treatise (in two
parts) Of Credulity and Incredulity, in Things Natural, Civil, and
Divine, came out in 1668, and was reissued, with a new title-page (as
above), in 1672. A third part, Of Credulity and Incredulity in Things
Divine and Spiritual, appeared in 1670. Webster’s assault upon Casaubon
in his Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft was made in apparent ignorance
of the fact that the venerable scholar had been dead for some years
(see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 24, below).</p>

1665, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 181-201 (with cuts). Most of the tricks which Scot describes
are identical with feats of legerdemain that are the stock in trade
of every modern juggler:—“To throwe a peece of monie awaie, and to
find it againe where you list” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 326); “To make a groat or a testor

decollation of John Baptist” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 349). The picture of the apparatus
required for the last-mentioned trick is very curious indeed (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 353).

<a href="#fnanchor_79"><span class="muchsmaller">[79]</span></a> Note, however, that the upholders of the current beliefs on
witchcraft are also many times emphatic enough in similar cautionary
remarks. A first-rate example is the following characteristic passage
from Dr. Casaubon, whom Webster calls a “witchmonger”:—</p>

<p class="footnote">“And indeed, that the denying of <em>Witches</em>, to them that content
themselves in the search of truth with a superficial view, is a very
plausible cause; it cannot be denied. For if any thing in the world,
(as we know all things in the world are) be liable to fraud, and
imposture, and innocent mistake, through weakness and simplicity; this
subject of Witches and Spirits is.... How ordinary is it to mistake
natural melancholy (not to speak of other diseases) for a Devil? And
how much, too frequently, is both the disease increased, or made
incurable; and the mistake confirmed, by many ignorant Ministers, who
take every wild motion, or phansie, for a suggestion of the Devil?
Whereas, in such a case, it should be the care of wise friends, to
apply themselves to the Physician of the body, and not to entertain
the other, (I speak it of <em>natural</em> melancholy) who probably may
do more hurt, than good; but as the learned Naturalist doth allow, and
advise? Excellent is the advice and counsel in this kind, of the Author
of the book <cite lang="la">de morbo Sacro</cite> attributed to <cite>Hippocrates</cite>,
which I could wish all men were bound to read, before they take upon
them to visit sick folks, that are troubled with melancholy diseases”

modern witchcraft that Bekker was punished, for it is in the last two
books of his treatise that he deals particularly with this subject,
and these did not appear until after he had been unfrocked. Still, his
Second Book, which got him into trouble, contains all the essentials.
It denies the power of the devil and wicked spirits to afflict men, and
holds that the demoniacs of the New Testament were neither possessed
nor obsessed, but merely sufferers from disease. For a full analysis
of Bekker’s work and an account of the opposition which it roused,

selbst sich zu erheben, welche das Vorhandensein gewisser, aus
den Begriffen der Zeit geschöpfter dämonologischen Vorstellungen
in der Bibel anerkennt, ohne daraus eine bindende Norm für den
Glauben herzuleiten,—diese war freilich erst einem späteren
Zeitalter vorbehalten. Bekker kannte, um seine sich ihm aufdringende
philosophische Ueberzeugung mit der Bibel zu versöhnen, keinen andern
Weg, als den der Üblichen Exegese, und daher kommt es, dass diese nicht
überall eine ungezwungene ist.”</span> It is instructive to note the pains
which Sir Walter Scott takes, in his Second Letter on Demonology and
Witchcraft, to harmonise the Bible with his views on these subjects.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_101"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_101"><span class="muchsmaller">[101]</span></a> To avoid all possibility of misapprehension I shall venture to
express my own feelings. The two men who appeal to me most in the whole
affair of witchcraft are Friedrich Spee, the Jesuit, and Balthasar
Bekker, the “intolerable” pastor of Amsterdam. But what I <em>feel</em>,
and what all of us feel, is not to the purpose. There has been too much
feeling in modern discussions of witchcraft already.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_105"><span class="muchsmaller">[105]</span></a> Jean d’Espaignet and Pierre de Lancre, the special commissioners,

for I have seen only one of de Lancre’s two books, and I find in it no
distinct statement of the number of witches convicted. He makes various
remarks, however, which seem to show that 600 is no exaggeration. Thus
he says that the Parliament of Bordeaux, under whose authority he
acted, condemned “an infinity” of sorcerers to death in 1609 (<span lang="fr">Tableau

bout”</span> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 38). The commission lasted from July to November (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 66,
456, 470); besides those that the two commissioners tried during this
period, they left behind them so many witches and wizards that the
prisons of Bordeaux were crowded and it became necessary to lodge

observations of great interest, in his Life of the Lord Keeper
Guilford, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 267-269 (<abbr title="edition">ed.</abbr> 1826). It is not clear whether North was
present at the trial or not. It is important to notice that North
wrote his biographies late in life and that his death did not take
place until 1736, the year in which the statute against witchcraft was
repealed.</p>

which was, that his brother Raymond’s passive behavior should let those
poor women die” (Life of the Lord Keeper Guilford, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 267). Raymond
was, to be sure, the judge who presided at the trial, but Francis North
cannot be allowed to have all the credit which his brother Roger would
give him, for he refused to reprieve the convicted witches (see his

his empire among us in the last age, he exercised it with greater
violence among the Indian Pawwaws, and our New England colonists”
(Richard Gough, British Topography, 1780, <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 254, note ᵖ); “The
colonists of [Massachusetts] appear to have carried with them, in an
exaggerated form, the superstitious feelings with regard to witchcraft
which then [at the time of the settlement] prevailed in the mother
country” (Introduction to the reprint of Cotton Mather’s Wonders of
the Invisible World, in the Library of Old Authors, 1862); “In the
dark and dangerous forests of America the animistic instinct, the
original source of the superstition, operated so powerfully in Puritan
minds that Cotton Mather’s <cite>Wonders of the Invisible World</cite> and
the Salem persecution surpassed in credulity and malignity anything
the mother country could show” (Ferris Greenslet, Joseph Glanvill,
New York, 1900, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 150-151); “The new world, from the time of its
settlement, has been a kind of health resort for the worn-out delusions
of the old.... For years prior to the Salem excitement, European
witchcraft had been prostrate on its dying bed, under the watchful and
apprehensive eyes of religion and of law; carried over the ocean it
arose to its feet, and threatened to depopulate New England” (George
M. Beard, The Psychology of the Salem Witchcraft Excitement, New York,
1882, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1).</p>

I have not considered here the bearing of this reversal, or of the
attempt to pay damages to the survivors or their heirs, because these
things came somewhat later. It must be noted, however, that all such
measures of reparation, whatever may be thought of their sufficiency,
were unexampled in the history of witch trials the world over, and
that they came before the last condemnation for witchcraft in England

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_176"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_176"><span class="muchsmaller">[176]</span></a> John Stearne, Hopkins’s associate, speaks of what he has
himself “learned and observed since the 25. of March 1645 as being
in part an agent in finding out or discovering some of those since
that time, being about two hundred in number, in Essex, Suffolke,
Northamptonshire, Huntingtonshire, Bedfordshire, Norfolke,
Cambridgeshire, and the Isle of Ely in the County of Cambridge,
besides other places, justly and deservedly executed upon their legall
tryalls” (A Confirmation and Discovery of Witch-craft, London, 1648,
To the Reader). Stearne wrote his book after the death of Hopkins,
which took place in 1647. In the life of Hopkins in the Dictionary of
National Biography, the Witch-Finder is said to have begun operations
in 1644. This is a manifest error. Hopkins himself (Discovery of
Witches, 1647, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 2, see below) says that his experiences began at
Manningtree “in <em>March</em> 1644,” but Stearne’s statement makes it
clear that this is Old Style, for Stearne was also concerned in the
Manningtree business, and the year is completely established by the
report of the proceedings,—A True and Exact Relation of the several
Informations [etc.] of the late Witches, London, 1645 ( <abbr title="compare" >cf.</abbr> T. B.
Howell’s State Trials, <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr>, 817 <abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>). The traditional statement that
Hopkins was hanged as a wizard ( <abbr title="compare" >cf.</abbr> Hudibras, Part <abbr title="two">ii</abbr>, canto 3, 11. 139
<abbr title="and following">ff.</abbr>) is disproved by the following passage in Stearne: “I am certain
(not-withstanding whatsoever hath been said of him) he died peaceably
at Manningtree, after a long sicknesse of a Consumption, as many of
his generation had done before him, without any trouble of conscience
for what he had done, as was falsly reported of him” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61). For
the record of his burial, Aug. 12, 1647, see Notes and Queries, 1st
Series, <abbr title="Ten">X</abbr>, 285. The notion that Hopkins was “swum” and, since he
floated, was subsequently hanged, most likely originated in a document
criticising his performances which was brought before the Norfolk
judges in 1646 or (more probably) in 1647. Hopkins printed a reply to
this document shortly before his death,—The Discovery of Witches: in
Answer to severall Queries, lately delivered to the Judges of Assize
for the County of Norfolk. And now published by Matthew Hopkins,
Witch-finder (London, 1647). The first “query,” as printed by Hopkins,
was this:—“That he must needs be the greatest Witch, Sorcerer, and
Wizzard himselfe, else hee could not doe it.” <abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> Wright, Narratives

<a href="#fnanchor_177"><span class="muchsmaller">[177]</span></a> Legge, Scottish Review, <abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII</abbr>, 273-274. Ady (A Candle in
the Dark, 1656, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 105) says: “A little before the Conquest of
<em>Scotland</em> (as is reported upon good intelligence) the Presbytery
of <em>Scotland</em> did, by their own pretended authority, take upon
them to Summon, Convent, Censure, and Condemn people to cruel death
for Witches and (as is credibly reported) they caused four thousand to
be executed by Fire and Halter, and had as many in prison to be tried
by them, when God sent his conquering Sword to suppress them.” The
“conquest” to which Ady refers is Cromwell’s in 1650. It is well known
that from 1640 to Cromwell’s invasion, witch prosecution ran riot in
Scotland, but that during his supremacy there were very few executions
in that country (see Legge, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 266-267). <abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8, <a href="#footnote_6">note 6</a>, above.</p>

and probably the last trial, in England. Mrs. Mary Hickes and her
daughter are said by Gough (British Topography, 1780, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 439, <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>,
254, note) to have been executed for witchcraft on July 28, 1716, at
Huntingdon. Gough cites a contemporary pamphlet as authority. The
genuineness of this case is doubted (see Notes and Queries, 1st Series,
<abbr title="Five">V</abbr>, 514; <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> Series, <abbr title="Five">V</abbr>, 503-504), but Mr. F. A. Inderwick argues for its
acceptance (Side-Lights on the Stuarts, <abbr title="second edition">2d ed.</abbr>, 1891, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 177-180),
and it has certainly never been disproved. The alleged executions
at Northampton in 1712 are certainly based on a slip of the pen in
Gough, British Topography, 1780, <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 52; the cases actually occurred
in 1612, and an account of them may be found in a tract (The Witches
of Northamptonshire) published in that year, and reprinted by Taylor

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
